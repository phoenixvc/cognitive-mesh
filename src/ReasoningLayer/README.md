# Reasoning Layer

## üéØ Overview

Welcome to the **Reasoning Layer**‚Äîthe cognitive core of the Cognitive Mesh platform. This layer is responsible for executing various forms of advanced reasoning, transforming raw data and simple queries into sophisticated insights, plans, and analyses. It acts as the "brain" of the system, where specialized cognitive engines work in concert to tackle complex problems.

The primary mission of the Reasoning Layer is to provide a modular, extensible, and powerful set of reasoning capabilities that enable the Cognitive Mesh to think, analyze, create, and strategize in a way that mimics and augments human cognition.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Responsibilities

The Reasoning Layer is responsible for a diverse set of cognitive functions:

-   **Analytical & Systems Thinking:** Deconstructing complex systems, identifying causal relationships, and performing data-driven analysis.
-   **Ethical & Compliance Reasoning:** Ensuring that all actions and decisions align with the foundational **Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework**. It validates outputs against normative principles and legal constraints.
-   **Security Reasoning:** Proactively identifying security threats, analyzing event patterns for anomalies, and calculating dynamic risk scores to support the **Zero-Trust Security Framework**.
-   **Creative & Critical Thinking:** Generating novel ideas, evaluating arguments for logical fallacies, and providing multi-perspective analysis.
-   **Domain-Specific Logic:** Applying specialized knowledge and heuristics for specific business domains (e.g., finance, healthcare) to provide expert-level insights.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

The Reasoning Layer is built upon a foundation of pure domain logic, adhering strictly to the principles of **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters)** architecture.

-   **Ports:** Each reasoning capability is exposed through a well-defined, technology-agnostic interface (Port), such as `IThreatIntelligencePort` or `IEthicalReasoningPort`. These contracts define *what* the engine does, not *how*.
-   **Engines:** The core logic for each reasoning type is encapsulated within a domain engine (e.g., `ThreatIntelligenceEngine`, `NormativeAgencyEngine`). These engines are pure C# classes with no direct dependencies on infrastructure, making them highly testable and portable.

Higher-level layers, such as the `MetacognitiveLayer` or `BusinessApplications` layer, interact with these engines exclusively through their ports, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and a decoupled architecture.

## üß© Major Components

The Reasoning Layer is composed of several specialized engines, each providing a unique cognitive capability.

| Component | Description | Key Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AnalyticalReasoning** | Performs data-driven analysis, identifies trends, and generates structured insights from complex datasets. | `AnalyticalReasoner.cs`, `AnalysisResultGenerator.cs` |
| **SecurityReasoning** | The core of our proactive defense strategy. It analyzes security events, detects threats, and calculates risk scores. | `IThreatIntelligencePort.cs`, `ThreatIntelligenceEngine.cs` |
| **EthicalReasoning** | Enforces the ethical and philosophical principles of the mesh. It validates actions against normative frameworks (Brandom) and information ethics (Floridi). | `INormativeAgencyPort.cs`, `InformationEthicsEngine.cs` |
| **SystemsReasoning** | Analyzes complex systems, identifying feedback loops, interdependencies, and leverage points based on systems thinking principles. | `SystemsReasoner.cs` |
| **CreativeReasoning** | Generates novel ideas, brainstorms solutions, and provides creative input for problem-solving tasks. | `CreativeReasoner.cs` |
| **CriticalReasoning** | Evaluates information for logical consistency, identifies biases, and assesses the strength of arguments. | `CriticalReasoner.cs` |
| **DomainSpecificReasoning** | A pluggable component for adding specialized reasoning logic for specific industries or business domains. | `DomainSpecificReasoner.cs` |

## üöÄ Usage Examples

Services in higher layers use dependency injection to get an instance of a reasoning port and invoke its methods. This ensures that the calling service is completely decoupled from the implementation details of the reasoning engine.

### Example: Using the Threat Intelligence Engine from the Metacognitive Layer

Here is how the `SecurityIncidentMonitor` in the `MetacognitiveLayer` might use the `IThreatIntelligencePort` to analyze security events.

```csharp
// In SecurityIncidentMonitor.cs (MetacognitiveLayer)

public class SecurityIncidentMonitor
{
    private readonly ILogger<SecurityIncidentMonitor> _logger;
    private readonly IThreatIntelligencePort _threatIntelPort;
    // ... other dependencies

    public SecurityIncidentMonitor(
        ILogger<SecurityIncidentMonitor> logger,
        IThreatIntelligencePort threatIntelPort,
        // ... other injected ports
    )
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _threatIntelPort = threatIntelPort;
    }

    public async Task AnalyzeAndEscalateIncidentAsync(SecurityIncident incident)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Analyzing incident {IncidentId}...", incident.IncidentId);

        var analysisRequest = new ThreatAnalysisRequest
        {
            Events = incident.CorrelatedEvents,
            Context = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "incidentId", incident.IncidentId } }
        };

        // Invoke the reasoning engine via its port
        var analysisResponse = await _threatIntelPort.AnalyzeThreatPatternsAsync(analysisRequest);

        if (analysisResponse.IsThreatDetected)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning("Threat detected for incident {IncidentId}: {Description}",
                incident.IncidentId, analysisResponse.ThreatDescription);
            
            // Escalate the incident based on the reasoning output
            await EscalateIncidentAsync(incident, analysisResponse);
        }
    }
}
```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

The Reasoning Layer is designed to be extensible. To add a new reasoning capability:

1.  **Define the Port:** Create a new interface in a `Ports/` directory that defines the contract for your new reasoning engine.
2.  **Implement the Engine:** Create a new class in an `Engines/` directory that implements the port interface. This class should contain the pure domain logic for the reasoning capability.
3.  **Register for DI:** Register the new port and its engine implementation in the dependency injection container.
4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Provide comprehensive unit tests for the new engine to ensure its correctness and reliability.
