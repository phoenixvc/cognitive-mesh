    enabling integration with various services including champion discovery, community
    analytics, learning resources, innovation tracking, and more.
    
    ## Authentication
    
    The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the
    `Authorization` header as a bearer token:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
    ```
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    
    - **Standard**: 1000 requests per minute per API key
    - **Burst**: 100 requests per second
    
    ## Versioning
    
    The API follows semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0). The current version is specified
    in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
