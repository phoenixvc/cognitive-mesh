# Connection-Centric Value Creation Tracker PRD

### TL;DR

Mesh service tracks how AI-driven workflows transform business
relationships—measuring trust-building, advisor positioning, and
follow-up quality. Delivers 'advisor-vs-vendor' scoring, cohort trust
trendlines, and predictive alerts on relationship risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve a 30% increase in 'trusted advisor' engagements, driving
  long-term business value.

- Reduce the risk and rate of customer churn through timely, actionable
  relationship insights.

- Enable data-driven coaching and follow-up by making invisible
  relationship trends visible to sales and success teams.

### User Goals

- Empower users to see and act on real-time trust, advisor, and
  relationship metrics.

- Give teams proactive alerts before accounts or relationships become at
  risk.

- Provide concrete, personalized insights to inform
  relationship-building actions with clients.

### Non-Goals

- This product will not automate core sales or service activities; it
  only provides insights and alerts.

- No outbound marketing or engagement actions will be triggered without
  explicit user approval.

- Does not handle payment data or billing operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Executives: oversee value generation and analytics.

- PMO: manage project and value tracking.

- Sales Leads: act on relationship insights and alerts.

- Customer Success Managers: intervene on at-risk accounts.

- Data Privacy Officers: ensure compliance and data protection.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- **As a Sales Lead**, I want to see in real time how my team's
  relationships are evolving, so that I can intervene early when trust
  fades and capitalize more on high-trust accounts.

- **As a Customer Success Manager**, I want to be automatically alerted
  when a key relationship is at risk, so that I can act before we lose
  the account.

- **As an Executive**, I want to analyze advisor-vs-vendor scorecards
  and cohort trust trends, so that I can shape training programs and
  resource allocation.

- **As a Data Privacy Officer**, I want to verify all relationship data
  is pseudonymized and strictly access-controlled, so that we maintain
  compliance and uphold user trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Connection-Metric Detection** (Priority: Must)

  - Records workflow events (meetings, tasks, feedback) and computes
    changes in trust, relationship depth, and follow-up quality.

  - Endpoint: POST /connections/track

  - Input: Workflow event payloads (pseudonymized).

  - Output: Delta metrics (trust, advisor index, follow-up quality,
    timestamp).

- **Advisor-Position Scorecard** (Priority: Must)

  - Delivers a real-time advisor-vs-vendor score for teams, accounts, or
    individuals.

  - Endpoint: GET /connections/scorecard

  - Response Time: <200ms

  - Output: Composite scores, trendline charts, comparison to cohort.

- **Trend/Cohort Analysis** (Priority: Must)

  - Time series tracking of trust progression, advisor positioning, and
    follow-up quality.

  - Endpoint: GET /connections/trends?range=...

  - Performance: Handles at least 1000 events/minute

- **Alerting on Relational Lapses** (Priority: Should)

  - Threshold-based triggers for notification when key metrics breach
    risk levels.

  - Endpoint: POST /connections/alert

  - Output: Email, dashboard, or CRM push alert with full context.

- **Pseudonymized (Hashed) Data & Audit Chain** (Priority: Must)

  - All PII and relationship data is hashed/anonymized.

  - Strict RBAC on all API endpoints

  - Full audit trail for every access, update, or trigger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all API endpoints and dashboards.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all value tracking and alert events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

  CRM/workflow tools.

- First-time users receive a guided walkthrough of the dashboard,
  heatmaps, and alerts.

- Permissions and data compliance terms are confirmed before access.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** System collects and ingests relationship/workflow events
  (e.g., meetings, calls, emails, follow-ups).

  - Minimal UI friction—automated event collection from the mesh and/or
    CRM integration.

  - Data is validated and pseudonymized before analysis.

  - Users see their data footprint and consent flow.

- **Step 2:** The backend computes trust, advisor status, and follow-up
  deltas after each event.

  - Advisor-vendor scorecards update in real time.

  - Core trust/relationship metrics are visualized on the dashboard with
    color-coded indicators.

- **Step 3:** Users access the scorecard via dashboard or API.

  - Fast, visual display and trendlines.

  - Access to cohort/peer benchmarking as well as drilled-down detail.

- **Step 4:** When thresholds for risk or missed follow-ups are
  breached, proactive alerts fire.

  - Admin users receive push/email alerts.

  - Status and recommendations appear directly in the dashboard or
    relevant CRM.

- **Step 5:** Trend analysis visualizes relationship health over any
  selected time range.

  - Historical and cohort analyses surface improvement or risk patterns.

  - Export options for coaching, reporting, and analysis.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Users can configure custom thresholds for key accounts or segments.

- Dashboards are responsive and accessible, optimized for desktop/tablet
  view.

- Edge cases (e.g., missing major data types) surface fast via error
  banners with remediation steps.

- Filters for business unit, region, or team.

- System gracefully handles duplicate or delayed event streams.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clear "advisor vs vendor" meters, colorblind-safe palette, and
  trendline visualization.

- Proactive, actionable alerts, not just notifications.

- Data minimization and opt-out controls visible to all users.

- Every score or trend can be traced back to auditable, pseudonymized
  source events.
