# Preparation vs. Performance Dual Architecture PRD

### TL;DR

The Preparation vs. Performance Dual Architecture is a mesh-based AI
service layer that combines robust offline scenario simulation and
pattern training (“Preparation”) with seamless real-time cognitive
support (“Performance”). Users receive tailored guidance before live
events and actionable AI assistance during them, optimizing both
readiness and in-the-moment outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Increase users' first-pass success rate in live events by at least
  40%.

- Reduce rework, missed insights, and associated costs through targeted
  pre-event training.

- Raise adoption of AI-guided performance support across
  mission-critical workflows.

### User Goals

- Enable thorough pre-event simulation, practice, and risk anticipation.

- Offer live AI support for transcription, suggestions, and confidence
  scoring during high-stakes moments.

- Deliver clear explanations and rationale for all suggestions and
  outputs.

- Ensure both modes (Preparation & Performance) are easy to access and
  switch between.

### Non-Goals

- Does not provide automated actions; all suggestions require user
  confirmation.

- Excludes integrations for third-party live streaming at initial
  launch.

- No deep-dive analytics dashboards in v1; focus is on core guidance and
  support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Project Leads: simulate and prepare for live events.

- Training Specialists: train AI models with historical data.

- Operators: receive real-time AI assistance during live events.

- Team Members: access confidence scoring and guidance.

- Compliance Reviewers: audit all guidance and model updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a **Project Lead**, I want to simulate and replay realistic event
  scenarios before they happen, so I can prepare my team for any
  situation.

- As a **Training Specialist**, I want to train the AI with historical
  data so the system is always up to date on the latest patterns.

- As an **Operator**, I want smart real-time prompts and cues as I
  navigate events, so I never miss an important detail.

- As a **Team Member**, I want to quickly see the system's confidence in
  its suggestions so I can trust when and how to act.

- As a **Compliance Reviewer**, I want every guidance step and model
  update to be fully auditable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

    - POST /prep/simulate — Accepts event and context, returns scenario
      variants and guidance in \<500ms.

  - **Pattern Training** (Must):

    - POST /prep/train — Accepts historical data, triggers background
      model update, acknowledges within 1s.

  - **Real-Time Processing** (Must):

    - WS /perf/process — Accepts live media/context input, emits
      processed output within 100ms per fragment.

      options in \<200ms.

  - **Confidence Forecasting** (Should):

    - GET /perf/confidence — Aggregates Preparation and Performance
      metrics to return overall confidence score (\<150ms).

- **Crosscutting**

  - All responses use the mesh-standard error envelope: { error_code,
    message, correlationID, data }.

  - Full audit log for all actions, suggestions, and model updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all preparation and performance endpoints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the solution via a dual-mode widget embedded in
  dashboards or apps.

- Upon first use, onboarding highlights the difference between
  Preparation and Performance modes, with tips for effective use.

- Tooltips and a short walkthrough help the user initiate their first
  simulation or live support session.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1: Select Mode (Prep or Perf)**

  - Mode is prominently toggleable; current state is persistent.

  - Contextual help surfaces relevant scenarios or active events.

- **Step 2: Preparation Workflow**

  - User provides event specification (e.g., details, objectives).

  - System returns a timeline with scenario variants and guidance.

  - User can replay, adjust inputs, and tag critical patterns for extra
    focus.

- **Step 3: Pattern Training**

  - Data import or direct upload interface (for admins/trainers).

  - Immediate acknowledgment; user sees a progress bar if model update
    is underway.

- **Step 4: Performance Workflow**

  - Live event/session started (e.g., meeting, incident response).

  - Live inputs (audio, text, video, logs) streamed securely to the
    system.

  - Processed output (transcription, suggestions) re-emitted in real
    time.

  - Color-coded risk/confidence meter shows trust level for each
    suggestion.

- **Step 5: Confidence Forecasting**

  - Accessible via widget; instantly displays system's certainty based
    on current Prep & Perf inputs.

  - Score and rationale are visible to inform user decisions.

- **Step 6: History and Rationale**

  - Users can review all prior sessions, guidance offered, and outcomes.

  - Each suggestion/decision links to its audit trail and underlying AI
    rationale.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Multi-threaded events: run multiple simulations and live sessions in
  parallel.

- Graceful failures: fallback messages and suggested next steps if model
  or service is unavailable.

- Recovery prompts: system offers recovery or retry when network or
  input issues occur.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clear, color-coded system states for reliability and risk.

- Accessible design: keyboard navigation, screen reader support,
  language localization ready.

- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile use.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Python FastAPI for API endpoints; Celery or custom job runner for
  asynchronous model training and simulation.

- High-speed inference layer for real-time performance
  endpoints—optimized with Node.js/Go, if needed, for streaming.

- Secure, versioned model storage; integration with audit-logging
  services.

### Integration Points

- Azure ML or alternative cloud-based job scheduling for pattern/model
  updates.

- Redis/Azure Table (or equivalent) for rapid context caching and
  replay.

- Authentication/authorization using company-standard SSO/JWT.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Input data (event specs, media streams) encrypted at rest and in
  transit.

- Short-term session context held in memory or encrypted cache;
  simulations/patterns stored in production-grade DB.

- Full audit trail for all user/model actions—compliance-ready and
  privacy respecting.

### Scalability & Performance

- Aggressively autoscale pods based on event/session load; target 50+
  concurrent simulation or training jobs.

- Ultra-low latency streaming for live events (\<100ms per step).

- Automatic failover for critical endpoints; retry and circuit breaker
  logic for dependent services.

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring real-time processing remains consistent across variable
  network and device conditions.

- Safely retraining models without disrupting live support.

- Balancing user trust with automated suggestions—explainability and
  override mechanisms are critical.
