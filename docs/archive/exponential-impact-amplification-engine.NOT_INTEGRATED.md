# Exponential Impact Amplification Engine PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

A scalable AI innovation engine that catalogs org-wide solutions with
LlamaIndex+Chroma, tracks adoption and success factors through Weights &
Biases, maps leadership emergence using NetworkX, and delivers
insight-rich dashboards via Streamlit. All engines are containerized for
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment using Helm and Bicep; all
client UIs are lightweight API consumers, not backend-hosted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve 10x acceleration in organization-wide adoption of successful
  automation and AI solutions.

- Reduce time-to-impact for innovations by ensuring critical solutions
  find their ideal audience automatically.

- Systematically mine, promote, and replicate traits of high-impact
  solutions to amplify organizational learning.

- Increase measurable collaboration/network connectivity between
  innovation leaders and their peers.

- Provide transparent, data-driven insights to leadership about the
  distribution and spread of innovation.

### User Goals

- Enable innovators to easily share, promote, and track the adoption of
  their AI solutions across the organization.

- Empower users to discover and implement proven solutions tailored to
  their specific roles and workflows.

- Surface actionable insights for users and teams about what drives
  successful innovation adoption.

- Help innovation leaders gain recognition by visualizing their
  influence and emergence within the organization.

### Non-Goals

- The platform will not manage or execute the actual workflow tasks
  (delegated to existing automation engines).

- Will not create or enforce access-level controls per solution at
  launch (will rely on org-level permissions).

- Does not provide end-user coaching or micro-interventions (handled by
  the coaching/mesh engines).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Innovators: submit and track adoption of AI solutions.

- Team Leads: monitor trending solutions and adoption drivers.

- Organizational Leaders: visualize network graphs and innovation spread.

- Platform Engineers: maintain infrastructure and deployment.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Innovator / Power User**

- As an innovator, I want my automated solution to be automatically
  cataloged and discoverable for similar roles across the organization,
  so that my work has maximum impact.

- As an innovator, I want to see analytics on who has adopted my
  solution and which success traits are most common, so I can improve my
  next contribution.

- As an innovator, I want to gain increased visibility and recognition
  as my innovations spread.

**Team Lead / Organizational Leader**

- As a team lead, I want to see which solutions are trending and what
  winning traits drive adoption, so I can encourage my teams to reuse
  proven best practices.

- As a leader, I want to visualize organizational network graphs to
  identify emerging innovation leaders and optimize knowledge sharing
  pathways.

**System / Platform**

- As the platform, I want to automatically surface 'winning traits' in
  high-impact solutions, so I can recommend them to others and increase
  the overall rate of adoption.

- As the system, I want to ensure the real-time updating of catalogs,
  leaderboards, and network graphs, maintaining high responsiveness and
  reliability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Solution Cataloging** (Priority: Critical)

  - Catalog all submitted solutions with semantic-rich metadata and
    vector embeddings using LlamaIndex+Chroma.

  - Make all catalog entries discoverable via semantic search
    (role/skill/task/domain).

- **Success Tracking** (Priority: High)

  - Track solution adoption events (who/when/context) with detailed
    attributes logged in Weights & Biases.

  - Surface recurring "winning traits" and adoption curves
    automatically; provide actionable insights and push these traits in
    recommendations.

- **Influence/Leadership Graph** (Priority: High)

  - Build and update a real-time organization-wide influence graph using
    NetworkX.

  - Show centrality, reach, and emergence data for each user/solution.

- **Dashboards & Insights** (Priority: High)

  - Deliver real-time, interactive dashboards with Streamlit: adoption
    curves, success factor analysis, leadership/innovation boards.

  - Expose all dashboard data through APIs for external UI/widgets
    integration.

- **APIs** (Priority: Critical)

  - POST /v1/amplify/innovation — Submit new solution

  - GET /v1/amplify/similar — Semantic search for related solutions

  - POST /v1/amplify/adoption — Log adoption event

  - GET /v1/amplify/success-patterns — Pull current winning factor
    insights

  - GET /v1/amplify/leadership/{user_id} — User's leadership/influence
    metrics

  - GET /v1/amplify/network — Organization influence network graph

- **Infrastructure & Deployment** (Priority: Critical)

  - All cataloging, mining, and graph engines run as containers in AKS
    (Helm + Bicep deployment).

  - Secrets are managed in Azure Key Vault; solution artifacts stored in
    Azure Blob or Files as per policy.

  - Dashboards/UIs/widgets deployed as CDN assets or API consumers only,
    not as backend containers (unless SSO/scale required).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all cataloging, tracking, and dashboard endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all solution submissions and adoption events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Solution cataloging and search response time <300ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the solution platform via a single dashboard link or
  embedded widget in the main company portal.

- First-time users are guided through a short onboarding that highlights
  how to submit, discover, and adopt innovations.

- Innovators prompted on submission to add metadata/tags for optimal
  discoverability.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Innovator submits a solution via the dashboard (or API).

  - Clear input forms for solution description, domain, time saved, and
    tags.

  - Automatic semantic enrichment (embedding, preliminary
    classification).

  - Success confirmation with direct link to their solution's adoption
    and influence analytics.

- **Step 2:** Other users search/discover solutions.

  - Intelligent semantic search enables users to find relevant solutions
    for their needs/roles.

  - Solutions are presented with adoption stats, preview traits, and
    'similar users' indicators.

  - Adoption and feedback require one-click, and trigger follow-up
    insights (e.g., "successful traits you share…").

- **Step 3:** Adoption and success tracking.

  - When a user adopts/logs a solution, event is registered along with
    contextual and performance data.

  - W&B metrics surface adoption patterns and trait correlations; user
    sees instant update in their dashboard.

- **Step 4:** Leadership & network graph.

  - Users/leaders can view an influence dashboard showing top
    innovators, their direct/indirect impact, and network proximity.

  - Insights call out emerging leaders and suggest high-impact
    connections.

- **Step 5:** Solution evolution.

  - Users can flag enhancements or fork/improve a solution, with all
    "descendant" solutions tracked in the catalog.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Bulk upload/import for teams wishing to catalog multiple legacy
  solutions.

- De-duplication and merging for similar or forked solutions.

- Robust error handling for failed submissions or API errors, always
  returning standardized error messages with actionable next steps.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Unified look and feel with parent organization style guide.

- Accessible, responsive layouts throughout (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Network/graph visualizations are zoom/pan enabled, supporting very
  large orgs.

- Data export options for admins (CSV, JSON, image graphs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
