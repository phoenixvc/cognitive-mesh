# Adaptive API Docs & Helper Overlay

### TL;DR

Dynamically adapts API documentation, playgrounds, and code samples to
match each user's AI maturity—providing guardrails, deep-dives, or
fast-tracks as appropriate. Overlays respond to activity/events, enable
living tutorials, and reduce ramp-up friction for new or advanced users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Reduce new user onboarding and API ramp-up time by 40%.

- Cut support requests and critical API errors by at least 30%.

- Drive adoption of advanced/secure API features among >50% of relevant
  user segments.

- Support continued increase in customer satisfaction (CSAT/NPS).

### User Goals

- Provide instantly relevant, contextual help—tailored by each user's
  maturity.

- Remove friction for beginners through in-doc guidance and inline
  validation.

- Enable advanced users to toggle straight to expert tips, advanced
  config, or skip mode.

- Ensure overlays never block or degrade the core documentation
  experience.

### Non-Goals

- Will not restrict user access to any core API docs or endpoints.

- Will not replace core documentation frameworks or external doc
  hosting.

- Will not require users to install additional plugins to consume
  overlays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Developer Relations: primary users for API docs and overlays.

- Admin/Doc Authors: manage overlay content and engagement metrics.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**End User – Novice**

- As a new user, I want proactive walkthroughs, safety warnings, and
  "try-it" code examples while exploring docs, so that I can confidently
  start building without mistakes.

- As a newcomer, I want my failed API attempts to trigger relevant help
  overlays, so that I can fix problems quickly.

**End User – Advanced**

- As a power user, I want overlays to default to advanced/hidden mode,
  surfacing only next-level tips or in-depth config when prompted, so
  that I stay productive.

**Admin/Doc Author**

- As an admin or doc author, I want to version, A/B test, and retire
  overlay content, so that users only see accurate and effective help.

- As an admin, I want to view engagement metrics for overlay content, so
  that I can optimize tutorials and guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Overlay Service**

  - Detects user maturity (XP, badge, role) and applies
    context-appropriate overlays in API docs or playgrounds.

- **Content Engine**

  - Maintains overlays, tips, advanced snippets, safety warnings—each
    version-controlled and tagged semantically for easy rollback,
    retirement, or A/B testing.

- **Trigger/Event Engine**

  - Defines which maturity events, usage patterns, or errors fire
    overlays. Mapping managed and updatable in admin UI.

- **Fallback Mode**

  - If overlays API or content engine fails, base documentation always
    renders—users never blocked from core content.

- **Telemetry**

  - Tracks overlay displays, interactions, dismissals, clicks, and
    related user actions for continuous improvement and reporting.

- **APIs**

  - /docs/overlay/load/:user loads overlays for the user profile.

  - /overlay/track_event logs overlay engagement events.

  - /overlay/content/admin supports admin operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥95% of overlay loads complete within 200ms.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all overlay events and user actions.

- 99.9% uptime for overlay and content APIs.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access API documentation or playground as usual. All overlays
  are injected natively; no extra steps required.

- First-time or low-maturity users are automatically prompted with
  welcome/tour overlays outlining basic docs usage and first API call.

- Opt-out or skip is clearly accessible.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User interacts with documentation or playground.

  - Overlay service detects maturity score and loads appropriate overlay
    set.

  - For low-maturity: Shows step-by-step guides, highlighted try-it
    buttons, and warnings.

  - For high-maturity: Collapses guidance, surfaces advanced config
    blocks.

  - Error or anomaly (e.g., multiple failed API calls) prompts
    troubleshooting overlay.

- **Step 2:** User interacts with overlays—reads, clicks CTAs,
  dismisses, or opts for advanced mode.

  - All interactions tracked via telemetry for feedback loops and admin
    insight.

- **Step 3:** As user matures (badges earned, errors resolved,
  documentation milestones reached), overlays progressively unlock more
  advanced content and fast-track features.

- **Step 4:** Overlay engine checks for content updates or retirement
  every 10 minutes, ensuring users only see up-to-date overlays.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Admin/Doc Author can retire outdated overlays or push experimental
  tips to A/B cohorts.

- If overlay service or content API fails, documentation loads with no
