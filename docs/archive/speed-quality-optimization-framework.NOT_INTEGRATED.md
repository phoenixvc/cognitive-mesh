# Speed-Quality Optimization Framework PRD

### TL;DR

A mesh service/sidecar that analyzes live task speed requirements versus
quality expectations, then computes and enforces a dynamic blend of AI
and human participation to maximize throughput while guaranteeing output
standards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Increase overall task throughput by 30% without sacrificing output
  quality.

- Maintain or exceed a 95% quality standard for all AI/Human blended
  processes.

- Reduce the incidence of missed deadlines caused by overemphasis on
  quality.

- Improve operational efficiency in high-volume, variable-complexity
  environments.

### User Goals

- Allow users to confidently shift focus between speed and quality as
  conditions require.

- Provide clear, real-time feedback on the current speed/quality setting
  and its implications.

- Prevent users from having to compromise between speed and quality.

- Instantly notify users if the current strategy puts quality or
  deadlines at risk.

### Non-Goals

- Does not automate purely judgment-based or subjective tasks—human
  oversight is always required.

- Will not intervene in workflows already governed by strict regulatory
  processes or fixed quality gates, except as an advisory layer.

- Does not provide detailed post-mortem analytics; product focuses on
  live, in-the-moment optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Team Leads: optimize team performance and quality standards.

- Individual Contributors: balance speed and quality in daily tasks.

- Operations Managers: monitor performance and compliance.

- QA Specialists: ensure quality standards are maintained.

- Business Owners: oversee automation and human oversight balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a **Team Lead**, I want the system to automatically suggest the
  optimal AI/Human participation mix so that my team reliably meets
  deadlines and quality standards.

- As an **Individual Contributor**, I want to see real-time
  recommendations for balancing speed and quality, so that I can adapt
  on the fly without worrying about missing targets.

- As an **Operations Manager**, I want full audit logs of all blend
  changes, so that I can review performance and compliance.

- As a **QA Specialist**, I want to be alerted immediately if any task
  is trending toward a quality shortfall, even if speed has increased.

- As a **Business Owner**, I want to ensure that automations do not
  override required human review steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Trade-off Analysis (Priority: Must)**

  - Feature Name: Live Task Analysis

    - Assess incoming task for speed and quality requirements.

    - API: POST /optimize/analyze

    - Returns quantitative deltas (speed pressure, quality bar) within
      150ms.

- **Optimization Strategy (Priority: Must)**

  - Feature Name: AI/Human Hybrid Planning

    - Given trade-off data, suggest optimal blend of human and AI
      effort.

    - API: POST /optimize/strategy

    - Returns actionable plan in under 200ms.

- **Real-Time Adjustment (Priority: Should)**

  - Feature Name: Dynamic Tuning

    - On user or system input, immediately recalculate and update the
      blend configuration.

    - API: PUT /optimize/tune

    - Adjusts plan as feedback or new data arrives.

- **Shared Error Envelope (Priority: Must)**

  - All endpoints respond with a unified error envelope schema.

- **Audit Logging (Priority: Must)**

  - All performance/quality switches and blend changes are logged for
    audit and operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all optimization and blend management endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all speed/quality optimization events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Optimization analysis response time <150ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users encounter the framework as a widget or sidecar module embedded
  in their workflow dashboard or primary productivity tool.

- For first-time users, a short guided tutorial overlays the main
  interface, explaining how the speed/quality toggle or slider
  functions.

- The system defaults to a balanced setting (baseline for the
  organization) and invites the user to observe how the blend impacts
  early tasks.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User starts or receives a new live task.

  - UI displays the speed/quality optimization widget prominently, with
    a real-time status indicator.

  - The system automatically runs POST /optimize/analyze using current
    task context.

  - If data is missing or the system cannot classify the task, a
    friendly prompt asks the user to provide input (e.g., deadline,
    quality bar).

- **Step 2:** System generates an optimized blend plan.

  - The control widget visually represents the planned blend (e.g., “60%
    AI, 40% Human”) and displays both expected completion time/risk and
    quality outcomes.

  - POST /optimize/strategy is invoked in the background and the result
    is immediately shown to the user.

  - The user can accept, tweak, or override suggestions via
    slider/toggle.

- **Step 3:** Live monitoring and adjustment.

  - As the user (and, if allowed, the system) makes adjustments, PUT
    /optimize/tune is invoked to update the blend.

  - Visual indicators alert the user if any change threatens the quality
    minimum or deadline; system locks out unsafe values if configured.

  - In-progress performance/quality metrics are streamed to keep the
    user informed.

- **Step 4:** Task completion and logging.

  - Upon completion, all optimization decisions, blend values, and their
    outcomes are logged for later audit and review.

  - UI displays summary of how the blend impacted throughput and
    quality.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can set custom blend profiles or rules for recurring task
  types.

- If the service detects a pattern of frequent last-minute quality
  saves, it can nudge users to reconsider their baseline balance.

- In the event of system latency or error, the widget clearly notifies
  the user and defaults to a safe, pre-agreed blend.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- High-contrast, universally intuitive slider or toggle for
  speed/quality adjustment.

- Responsive, real-time feedback and warnings.

- Accessible design: keyboard operable, screen-reader support, and
  tooltips for key metrics.

- All critical alerts are color-coded and include plain language
  explanations.
