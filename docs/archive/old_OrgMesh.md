# Organizational Cognitive Mesh Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Transformation Scoped)

### TL;DR

This backend builds a first-class Organizational Transformation Layer
into the Cognitive Mesh. It enables real-time cultural context
engineering, dual manifesto/policy management, continuous safety and
sovereignty monitoring, adoption velocity tracking, identity progression
support, and actionable organizational feedback. APIs are
contract-bound, NFRs are strictly defined, overlays are auditable, and
all integration points are designed for transparency, compliance, and
agility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Drive systematic and measurable transformation toward AI-augmented
  culture at the organizational level

- Ensure legal, compliance, and risk management requirements are met for
  all AI-powered workflows

- Accelerate safe and impactful adoption of AI across teams and roles,
  tracked and benchmarked in real time

- Monitor and increase employee engagement, psychological safety, and
  innovation velocity

- Establish the Cognitive Mesh as a differentiator in organizational
  learning and transformation

### User Goals

- Employees, managers, and leaders can clearly see how AI is impacting
  their roles and how to navigate professional identity evolution

- Teams feel psychologically safe experimenting with AI and reporting
  challenges or failures

- All stakeholders have direct visibility into manifesto, policy, and
  collective progress, with opportunities for feedback

- Passion-driven AI projects and adoption wins are recognized, tracked,
  and amplified

- Users understand sovereignty options and their right to informed,
  empowered AI usage

### Non-Goals

- Does not govern AI model selection, algorithm-level optimization, or
  individual tool licensing

- Does not prescribe industry- or role-specific AI workflows beyond
  providing flexible frameworks

- Excludes foundational LLM, cognitive agent, or knowledge retrieval
  capabilities unless used for organizational overlays

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- CXOs: oversee transformation and adoption.

- HR: manage employee engagement and feedback.

- Compliance Officers: ensure legal and policy compliance.

- Team Leads: drive team-level adoption and feedback.

- Employees: interact with dashboards and overlays.

- IT/Admins: manage configuration and onboarding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**People Operations Manager**

- As a People Ops Manager, I want to view a real-time dashboard of AI
  adoption, psychological safety, and sovereignty signals, so that I can
  tailor support and direct interventions to the right teams.

**Team Lead**

- As a Team Lead, I want to log and review team feedback on AI
  experimentation, so that I can normalize failure, surface passion
  projects, and celebrate meaningful successes.

**Compliance Officer**

- As a Compliance Officer, I want to review the latest policy and
  manifesto versions, audit change records, and monitor for policy drift
  or overdue updates, so that the organization stays compliant and
  audit-ready.

**Employee**

- As an Employee, I want to give feedback on my AI experiences, see how
  my identity is evolving, and access passion project communities, so
  that I feel safe and motivated to use AI in my work.

**AI Governance Lead**

- As a Governance Lead, I want to configure organization-level
  parameters (safety threshold, review frequency), receive migration
  notifications, and control transparency overlays, so that governance
  is transparent and future-proof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Cultural Transformation Management** (Priority: High)

  - Track, analyze, and report signals from meeting logs, direct
    feedback, audits, and employee input on adoption, migration, ritual,
    and communication

- **Manifesto and Policy Dual-Document Management** (Priority: High)

  - Version-controlled, CRUDable Manifesto and Policy APIs

  - Automated registry, Slack/email notifications for all drafts,
    migration triggers, reviews, and overdue events

- **Psychological Safety Monitoring** (Priority: High)

  - Aggregate experimentation signals, failure-reports, and sovereignty
    preferences organization-wide

- **Adoption Velocity Tracking** (Priority: Medium)

  - Measure and report adoption rates, passion-driven project momentum,
    and cross-team innovation velocity

- **Identity Transformation Management** (Priority: Medium)

  - Track professional identity progression (Fear  Familiar  Fluent 
    Fun) and support overlays for self-assessment and milestone
    celebration

- **Feedback and Notification Processing** (Priority: High)

  - Collect meeting, training, and feedback data via scalable adapters
    and escalate issues or insights as overlays, notification, or
    registry entries

- **Migration and Drift Handling** (Priority: High)

  - Automated detection of schema/register drifts and support for
    contract-bound migration overlays

- **Configurable Governance** (Priority: High)

  - Parameterized org-level YAML/JSON configs for key policies (review
    cycles, safety thresholds, passion enablement)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- 99.9% uptime for all dashboard and API endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all transformation and feedback events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- System is enabled centrally by the AI Governance or IT Admin via
  secure credentialing and config (YAML/JSON)

- Teams and admins receive onboarding overlays introducing manifesto,
  policy, sovereignty principles, and feedback mechanisms
