# Systematic Innovation Rhythm PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

Automate and optimize the innovation cadence (Sunday reviews / Friday
builds) for individual teams using Prefect workflow orchestration,
MLflow impact logging, LightGBM-powered template recommendations, and
DVC for artifact/version control. Core jobs and AI recommendations run
as Helm-managed services on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provisioned
via Bicep; end-users interact only via dashboards, plugins, or
notifications through API endpoints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Double the number of completed innovation cycles and automation
  adoptions per quarter.

- Track and increment realized "innovation velocity" across teams, with
  target increases per quarter.

- Reduce friction in solution development, achieving \>80% completion
  rates for innovation cycles.

- Make innovation results fully auditable and reproducible.

### User Goals

- Enable teams and individuals to select the optimal solution template
  based on AI-driven impact prediction.

- Provide actionable, prepopulated plans for every innovation cycle with
  minimal manual effort.

- Deliver instant feedback and post-cycle impact analytics to reinforce
  learning and improvement.

- Visualize innovation velocity and adoption trends.

### Non-Goals

- Manual QA or validation of every innovation cycle output.

- Handling project management/time tracking outside the defined
  innovation cycle context.

- Automating deeply custom, non-repeatable workflows that do not
  generalize beyond a single team.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Innovators: receive template recommendations and log outcomes.

- Team Leads: monitor cycle progress and adoption trends.

- System Admins: manage orchestration and auditability.

- Platform Engineers: maintain infrastructure and deployment.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Innovator**

- As an innovator, I want template recommendations to be tailored by
  past cycle results, so that I maximize my chance of success.

- As an innovator, I want to log outcomes and lessons learned, so that
  my future cycles get even better recommendations.

**Team Lead**

- As a team lead, I want weekly innovation cycle dashboards, so that I
  can spot blockers early and keep the team moving.

- As a team lead, I want to track adoption and impact for cycles, so
  that I can justify time investments.

**System**

- As a system, I want to continually refine templates and
  recommendations using impact outcomes, so each week's guidance
  improves.

  - User clicks "Start Innovation Cycle" → AI recommends top 3
    templates, with predicted impact scores and rationale.

  - User selects a template, edits plan if desired, and confirms.

  - Prefect flow triggers the cycle, data logged to MLflow, and UI
    updates cycle status.

- **Step 2: During the Week**

  - User receives reminders (Slack/Teams/email, or dashboard) for
    selected review/build steps.

  - User can add progress notes, blockers, and interim feedback via API
    or dashboard.

- **Step 3: Friday Build**

  - User (or automation) completes build; cycle "complete" is submitted.

  - User/automation uploads artifacts/results, fills in
    satisfaction/impact.

  - All data logged (MLflow), artifacts versioned (DVC).

- **Step 4: Velocity Tracking & Analytics**

  - Dashboard updates with new cycle, velocity, and adoption stats.

  - AI uses outcomes to re-train template recommendations for the next
    week.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can A/B test templates or manually trigger retraining.

- Admins can audit or roll back cycles from DVC logs.

- All error states clearly surfaced via dashboard or API error envelope,
  with support links.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Accessible, responsive UI optimized for both desktop and mobile.

  blocked).

- Clear call-to-actions and in-app explanations of predicted impact.

- Inline error messages, blocking actions, and validation for incomplete
  data or misfires.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

Each Sunday, a team sits down (virtually or in-person) to tackle the
coming week's innovation cycle. Instead of sifting through countless
templates or past efforts, the team is greeted with a shortlist of
AI-recommended templates—curated specifically for their challenge, their
domain, and what has historically worked the best. They select a
template, tweak their plan, and the system spins up tasks, reminders,
and dashboards to keep them on track. On Friday, as the build work wraps
up, results and artifacts are instantly logged and analyzed, feeding
right back into the AI engine. Teams watch their innovation "velocity"
accelerate week over week—seeing a tangible, data-backed view of their
impact and adoption. If anything goes wrong, every task and result is
auditable and recoverable, while leadership sees clear, actionable proof
of time saved and solutions shipped. The result: innovation that
compounds and scales, powered by both human creativity and smart
orchestration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Prefect orchestration running as AKS CronJobs for Sunday/Friday flows.

- MLflow and DVC for tracking artifacts, metrics, and version-controlled
  templates.

- LightGBM deployed as AKS service for low-latency recommendations.

- All user/UI integrations live as thin API consumers, not full
  containers.

### Integration Points

- SSO/mesh authentication for seamless login.

- Azure Blob/File for artifact storage.

- Slack/Teams/email for notifications and reminders.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Metrics and metadata persisted in MLflow (Azure-backed).

- Artifacts in DVC, with Azure Blob/File as the remote.

- Compliance with all standard Azure security/NFRs.

- All user data encrypted in transit and at rest (TLS 1.2+,
  Azure-managed keys).

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 50 concurrent cycles initially; easily scaled by
  increasing AKS node pools and CronJob concurrency.

- Storage and compute scale horizontally.

### Potential Challenges

- Synchronization of results/artifacts between DVC and MLflow pipelines.

- User drop-off in multi-step cycles.

- Handling retries or failover on AKS outages (addressed via Helm/Bicep
  health checks, Azure Monitor).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- XS (1–2 days): Base Prefect flows, CLI tool, and initial cycle API.

- Small (1 week): Full MLflow+DVC backend, API contracts, and velocity
  dashboard.

- Medium (2–3 weeks): LightGBM model integration, retraining, and
  artifact audit pipeline.

### Team Size & Composition

- Small Team: 2x (Product/PM + Engineer/DevOps; can be combined
  short-term)

- Leverage internal design/dev for dashboard widgets (1 extra for UI, as
  needed).

### Suggested Phases

**Phase 1: MVP Prefect + MLflow API (3 days)**

- Deliver: Prefect AKS CronJob, minimum cycle API in Python, connect to
  MLflow.

- Dependencies: Azure AKS, MLflow setup.

**Phase 2: DVC Integration (1 week)**

- Deliver: Artifact version control, dashboard for cycle progress,
  audit/rollback.

- Dependencies: Azure Blob access, DVC config.

**Phase 3: AI-Driven Recommendations (1–2 weeks)**

- Deliver: LightGBM model, retraining workflow, production template rec,
  A/B.

- Dependencies: Basis cycle/test data for model seed.

**Phase 4: User Analytics, Notifications, QA (3–5 days)**

- Deliver: Complete velocity reports, notification by Teams/Slack,
  tracking for adoption/events.

- Dependencies: Access to all relevant mesh user data and channels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Integration Strategy

- **Prefect**: Orchestrates cycles as AKS CronJobs (Pythonic, dynamic
  graph, Azure native).

- **MLflow**: Logs time saved, quality, adoption metrics (impact
  scoring).

- **DVC**: Artifact/template version control, YAML pipelines,
  audit/rollback.

- **LightGBM**: Predictive template ranking—chosen for low
  memory/compute, fast AzureML/MLflow fit over XGBoost.

- **All Orchestrators/ML modules**: AKS Helm/Bicep deployments.

- **User Interfaces**: Dashboard, notifications, and widgets as
  API-consuming clients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OSS/Service Alternatives & Recommendations

- **Prefect vs Airflow**: Prefect is preferred for dynamic flows,
  Python-native API, smoother Azure/AKS integration. Airflow possible
  for giant, legacy DAGs only.

- **LightGBM vs XGBoost**: XGBoost for large, complex projects but
  LightGBM recommended for memory/performance in AKS.

- **MLflow (must-have), DVC (recommended)**: DVC for heavy artifact
  pipelines, MLflow's own built-in artifacts for simple cases; both
  integrate fine, but DVC covers audit/version needs at scale.

- **Bicep for Azure Infra**: Preferred over vanilla ARM, supports Helm.
  Terraform a fallback if cross-cloud needed.

- **All clusters/services run as AKS Deployments/CronJobs via Helm; user
  interfaces and notification clients hit the AKS/API surface only.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Layer Mapping & Shared Schemas

- Prefect flows, LightGBM, MLflow, DVC: All as Helm/Bicep-deployed AKS
  services.

- Artifact and impact metadata versioned in DVC/MLflow.

- APIs at /docs/openapi/innovation/v2 (OpenAPI 3.x).

- UI/notifications as external API clients.

## Narrative

On Sunday mornings, teams no longer rely on inspiration or luck—they use
their data. With the Systematic Innovation Rhythm, the most promising
solution templates—pre-ranked using organization-wide results—are just a
click away. From the first trigger to the last artifact upload, every
cycle is orchestrated, logged, versioned, and analyzed. AI learns which
tactics actually move the needle. By the end of the week, not only do
teams finish builds with clarity, but the entire org can see what's
gaining ground, what still sticks, and how fast they're really
accelerating. Leadership amplifies the winners, blockers are surfaced
and cleared, and everyone's next cycle gets a little smarter.
