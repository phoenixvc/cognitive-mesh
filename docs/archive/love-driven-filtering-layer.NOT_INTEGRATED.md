# Love-Driven Filtering Layer PRD

### TL;DR

A human-in-the-loop mesh microservice (Kubernetes/Helm) and widget that
filters AI-generated experiment outputs through human purpose, passion,
and value criteria, ensuring only resonant, 'mattering' solutions
progress. Brings meaning and care to AI-scale ideaflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Ensure mass-scale AI ideation translates only into solutions that
  matter for users and the organization.

- Drive higher intrinsic motivation and engagement through alignment
  with user passion and mission.

- Reduce wasted effort on high-throughput experiments that lack
  organizational or human resonance.

- Improve implementation rates of AI-generated innovation by
  prioritizing high-significance ideas.

### User Goals

- Empower users to see their core values and passions directly
  influencing which solutions are considered.

- Deliver personalized, meaningful recommendations reflecting users'
  purpose and domains of care.

- Enable easy setup and ongoing curation of personal and team
  passion/value profiles.

- Provide actionable transparency on why ideas are selected or filtered.

### Non-Goals

- Not intended to automate final decision-making on implementation;
  human judgment remains essential.

- Does not collect or utilize sensitive PII for purposes outside
  resonance scoring.

- Out-of-scope for fully automating team/org-level passion modeling
  without explicit user/admin curation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</table>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all filtering and profile management endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all filtering decisions and profile changes.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Idea significance scoring response time <100ms per batch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- From dashboard or experiment results page, user is prompted to set up
  a personal or team "purpose profile."

- Quick onboarding wizard steps user through passions, values, and
  domains of care with suggestions, examples, and easy editing.

- Upon completion, user receives confirmation and first set of filtered
  recommendations.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User receives or requests batch of AI-generated experiment
  results.

  - UI clearly marks which ideas "match" user's profile and degree of
    resonance.

  - Batch results are retrieved in under one second, with filter
    explained.

- **Step 2:** User can endorse/flag, provide feedback, or request more
  detail on scoring.

  - Inline actions update their model and log rationale (with undo).

- **Step 3:** User or team can request "top-ranked" ideas at any
  time—filtered and sorted for greatest purpose-alignment.

  - Each idea carries a "why it matters to you" tooltip.

- **Step 4:** Admin/team leads can set, review, and refine org-level
  overlays or soft constraints.

  - Simple editor with preview of impact.

- **Step X:** Any edge case (no suitable ideas, model unresponsive) is
  handled gracefully—UI reflects "neutral" fallback, guides user to
  retrain or reset profile.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can weight profile aspects (e.g., "care most about impact
  on learning," less about "past domain").

- If filter model is temporarily unavailable, UI shows "unfiltered" mode
  with warning and opt-in to continue.

- Privacy dashboard for managing and deleting personal profile data.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Fast, plugin-driven widget (\<500 KB), accessible from any
  mesh-integrated dashboard.

- WCAG AA+ color contrast and full keyboard navigation.

- All tooltips/support are context-sensitive, with clear links to manage
  consent and feedback history.

## Narrative

Imagine Ava, an R&D project manager overwhelmed by a flood of
AI-generated experiment ideas—most promising, but many tangential or
irrelevant to her core mission. With the Love-Driven Filtering Layer,
Ava's team quickly sets their "purpose profiles," defining the passions
and problems that truly matter to them. When the weekly batch of
experiments arrives, Ava sees only those ideas deeply aligned to team
values—clearly marked and ranked. She gives instant feedback on edge
cases, easily tweaking her team's filter. Over time, Ava notices her
team's motivation and implementation rates soar, as every idea they
consider resonates with their deeper purpose and mission.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Kubernetes/Helm mesh microservice; scalable REST API endpoints for all
  profile, scoring, and feedback flows.

- Plugin widget, driven by API; code-signing and config via plugin
  registry.

- Encrypted data storage for all profiles/values.

### Integration Points

- Direct integration with mesh core experiment batch generator (consumes
  experiment result batches).

- Admin/analytics dashboard hooks: Prometheus & Grafana dashboard for
  filter actions and telemetry.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All user and org profiles stored encrypted at rest (Azure
  Blob/Cosmos); access via RBAC-enforced API layer.

- No user PII or profile details exposed in experiment logs; strict API
  payload validation.

- Opt-in consent flows; support for data deletion requests.

### Scalability & Performance

- Pod autoscaling to handle \>1000 concurrent user batch filter
  requests.

- High concurrency API pool for rapid batch scoring.

### Potential Challenges

- Cold start or batch latency during high-load situations.

- Balancing privacy/compliance with meaningful recommendation scope.

- Driving initial profile setup to hit adoption and success metrics.
