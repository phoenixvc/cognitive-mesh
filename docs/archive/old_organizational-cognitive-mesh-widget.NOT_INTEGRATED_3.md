# Organizational Cognitive Mesh Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Transformation Scoped)

### TL;DR

Widget suite operationalizes Organizational Cognitive Mesh: empowers
users, admins, and leaders to drive cultural transformation, manifestos,
safety assurance, identity evolution, passion-driven AI, adoption
velocity, and compliance. All panels and adapters are contract-bound,
CI-tested, and auditable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve 100% AI adoption at the organizational level by making
  transformation visible, actionable, and supported in daily workflows.

- Increase employee AI-proficiency and comfort by tracking and publicly
  celebrating cognitive sovereignty, identity evolution, and
  psychological safety.

- Normalize AI experimentation and failure as core to innovation,
  reducing resistance and aligning cultural practices across teams.

- Ensure compliance and transparency through persistent policy/manifesto
  versioning, audit trails, and clear communication overlays.

### User Goals

- Give every employee a transparent, self-serve map for their AI
  journey—showing sovereignty, safety, and personal/professional
  evolution.

- Allow teams to showcase adoption wins, share passion-driven projects,
  and match for mentorship.

- Enable admins to monitor safety, adoption health, and velocity;
  trigger interventions and provide feedback in real time.

- Provide frictionless reporting, migration flows, and overlays to
  ensure no one is left behind in transformation.

- Offer rights-respecting, autonomy-supportive settings for those who
  move at a different pace (“sovereignty-first” users).

### Non-Goals

- This product does not enforce a single mandatory AI adoption pace for
  all individuals.

- It does not expose granular employee-level AI usage without consent
  (privacy-respecting by design).

- The widgets do not deliver standalone enterprise training or serve as
  an exclusive identity management platform.
