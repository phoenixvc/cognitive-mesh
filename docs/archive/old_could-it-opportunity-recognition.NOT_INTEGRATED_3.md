# Could It ...? Opportunity Recognition System PRD

### TL;DR

An always-on engine and UI widget that continuously probes every
detected workflow friction with "Could it ...?" prompts, surfacing and
ranking AI-augmentation opportunities in real time. Teams can instantly
trial high-potential ideas and track impact, accelerating innovation and
reducing unaddressed bottlenecks across the organization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Generate 3× more actionable AI opportunities per week per team.

- Rapidly reduce friction points across critical workflows with targeted
  AI augmentation.

- Increase the rate of successful AI-driven process changes in pilot
  teams.

- Power dynamic, innovation-centric culture among distributed and hybrid
  teams.

### User Goals

- Ensure no bottleneck or inefficiency goes unaddressed thanks to timely
  "Could it ...?" prompts.

- Enable swift formation and implementation of experiments to resolve
  friction points.

- Allow teams to visualize, compare, and prioritize opportunities for
  improvement within their existing dashboards.

- Make it easy for teams to give feedback and refine opportunity
  discovery, sharpening relevance over time.

### Non-Goals

- Replacing deep process reengineering or consultancy.

- Automating core operational decisions without human intervention.

- Serving as a data warehouse or comprehensive analytics dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Innovation Leads: drive opportunity discovery and experimentation.

- Team Members: identify friction points and trial new solutions.

- Experiment Facilitators: track outcomes and optimize processes.

- Business Analysts: measure impact and ROI of opportunities.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Innovation Lead**

- As an Innovation Lead, I want my team to receive a continuous feed of
  new AI-augmented solution angles—"could it connect...?", "could it
  automate...?", "could it merge...?"—so that every workflow pain or
  friction point is addressed quickly and creatively.

- As an Innovation Lead, I want metrics on how many new opportunities
  are surfaced and trialed, so I can report impact and ROI.

**Team Member**

- As a Team Member, I want to easily generate and launch experiments on
  any surfaced idea, so that I can help eliminate friction from my
  workflow without waiting for formal process changes.

- As a Team Member, I need a clear view of previous attempts and their
  outcomes, so that duplicate trials are minimized and best ideas win.

**Experiment Facilitator**

- As an Experiment Facilitator, I want to track which opportunities are tested, how
  quickly, and where measurable improvements are seen, so I can
  accelerate what works and discard what doesn't.

## Functional Requirements

- **Prompt Template Library** (Priority: Must)

  - GET /couldit/templates: Returns a list of canon and custom "Could it
    ...?" prompts for users and system engines in <100ms.

  - Filter by domain, function, or task to ensure prompts are relevant.

  - Maintain up-to-date template versions, with admin rights for custom
    prompts.

- **Opportunity Recognition** (Priority: Must)

  - POST /couldit/recognize: Analyzes a provided team context and
    returns a ranked, annotated set of actionable AI augmentation
    opportunities in <250ms.

  - Includes opportunity "score" (impact, feasibility), annotation
    (most similar past fixes), and friction linkages.

  - Supports bulk context submission for periodic or scheduled sweeps.

- **Discovery Metrics** (Priority: Should)

  - GET /couldit/metrics: Returns real-time metrics on opportunity
    discovery—speed, creativity index, reduction of team paralysis,
    total opportunities surfaced and acted upon.

- **Team-Based Experiment Scheduler** (Priority: Could)

  - POST /couldit/experiment: Accepts opportunity IDs and returns a
    detailed, schedulable trial plan for team-based testing in <200ms.

  - Track trial status, responsible parties, time to outcome, and
    experiment result (win, partial, drop).

  - Integrate with team's existing workflow/task management tools via
    webhooks or direct API.

- **Security/Audit**

  - RBAC enforced on all endpoints—only authorized team contexts
    accessible.

  - Standard error envelope for all API responses.

  - Full audit log of every prompt selection, opportunity surfaced, and
    scheduled experiment (with correlation to org/tenant and agent
    origin).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all opportunity recognition and experiment endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all opportunity discovery and experiment events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Opportunity recognition response time <250ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Embedded widget in every team dashboard—highlights active "Could it
  ...?" stream and latest surfaced opportunities.

- Contextual onboarding/tour for first-time users—explains prompt
  mechanics, recognition cycles, and how to trial new opportunities.

- Simple settings selection: choose task/workflow domains to monitor,
  notification frequency for new prompts.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Team encounters a pain/friction point (logged manually or
  detected by mesh monitor).

  - Widget highlights the friction and presents a rotating,
    context-aware set of "Could it ...?" prompts.

- **Step 2:** User selects the prompt most relevant to their pain point
  or submits their context for analysis.

  - The system POSTs to /couldit/recognize and shows a shortlist of
    top-ranked augmentation candidates.

- **Step 3:** Team member clicks to schedule/launch an experiment.

  - A POST to /couldit/experiment sets up a trial and notifies the team,
    with prefilled best practices and timeline.

- **Step 4:** Team monitors progress directly in the widget, with
  updates on experiment impact, resolution status, and metrics.

- **Step 5:** After trial, success or learnings are fed back, refining
  prompt relevance and pattern matching.

- **Step X:** Team views running discovery scorecard and leaderboard,
  comparing week-on-week gains.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users define custom prompts or advanced triggers, linked to
  upstream system events (e.g., error spikes).

- Out-of-hours or duplicate experiment scheduling suppressed by policy.

- All experiment plans exportable for compliance or cross-team sharing.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Visually distinctive prompt carousel with quick-action shortcuts.

- Clear "last surfaced" and "actioned" indicators.

- Accessibility: full keyboard control, contrast themes, screen
  reader-friendly.

## Narrative

In a dynamic, fast-moving organization, teams constantly run into
process bottlenecks and workflow snags that slow progress, reduce
morale, and sap creative energy. Traditional response cycles—waiting for
feedback, escalation, and formal approval—mean that friction points
linger and repeat, rarely surfacing the best solution in the moment. The
"Could It ...?" Opportunity Recognition System transforms this paradigm by
listening for pain points in real-time, instantly presenting "Could it
...??" prompts tailored to the team's context and history.

Now, when a friction is detected—whether by the user, the mesh, or an
external trigger—the widget leaps into action, suggesting creative,
AI-driven solutions: "Could it analyze and auto-prioritize?", "Could it
find the missing link?", "Could it automate this step?" Within seconds,
the engine surfaces the most promising candidates, ranked by feasibility
