# Real-Time Cognitive Augmentation Layer PRD

### TL;DR

Mesh service that detects human cognitive bottlenecks in live tasks—such
as throughput, memory gaps, and overload—and injects AI augmentation
tools (transcription, contextual recall, real-time pattern recognition)
to instantly boost accuracy and decision speed. Targeted for teams and
users operating under high pressure or cognitive load.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Reduce decision latency by 50% in mission-critical processes (measured
  by average response/decision time).

- Uncover bottlenecks that cost time and create downstream errors,
  enabling continuous process improvement.

- Lower organizational risk by ensuring critical facts or context are
  always surfaced in real time.

### User Goals

- Ensure key facts and cues are never missed in high-speed or complex
  situations.

- Receive instant AI-powered prompts or context during rapid work
  sessions.

- Minimize user "friction" or lag when making complex, information-dense
  decisions.

### Non-Goals

- Does not attempt to automate subjective human judgments or emotional
  intelligence.

- Will not replace users in overall task execution; strictly augments
  and supports.

- Out of scope for tasks that are fully asynchronous or low-stake (not
  real time, not high pressure).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Ops Leads: monitor team performance and deploy AI augmentation aids.

- End Users: receive real-time AI assistance during high-pressure situations.

- Decision Makers: benefit from memory extension and pattern recognition.

- Performance Analysts: measure cognitive bottleneck reduction and decision speed improvements.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Ops Lead**

- As an Ops Lead, I want to see where teams slow down or miss crucial
  details, so that I can deploy live AI aids (like recall popups or
  pattern alerts) before errors propagate.

**End User**

- As a team member in a high-velocity meeting or support call, I want
  the AI to feed me relevant facts or warnings instantly, so I never
  miss key points in the discussion.

- As a decision maker, I want real-time transcription and memory
  extension to surface related facts from prior cases, so I can act
  quickly with confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Bottleneck Detection (Must)**

  - POST /augmentation/bottlenecks

    - Given a live task/context, detects speed/memory/complexity
      bottlenecks.

    - Returns structured bottleneck analysis in under 200 ms.

- **Augmentation Strategy Generation (Must)**

  - POST /augmentation/strategy

    - Takes detected bottlenecks and recommends the most effective AI
      injects (transcription, recall, pattern analysis).

    - Response in under 150 ms.

- **Realtime Transcription (Must)**

  - WS /augmentation/transcribe

    - Streams audio/video in, emits timestamped text in under 50 ms
      after speech.

    - Supports multi-speaker and noisy environments.

- **Memory Extension: Contextual Recall (Should)**

  - GET /augmentation/memory?query=

    - Surfaces relevant facts, quotes, or summaries from past tasks or
      databases.

    - Responds under 100 ms.

- **Pattern Recognition Aid (Should)**

  - POST /augmentation/patterns

    - Takes user options, decisions, or context and returns
      close-matching historical cases with outcomes.

    - Response under 200 ms.

- **All endpoints use a mesh-standard error envelope:**  
  { error_code, message, correlationID, data }  
  for every success or error response.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all cognitive augmentation endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all bottleneck detection and augmentation events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Bottleneck detection response time <200ms, transcription latency <50ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users open their primary dashboard (CRM, deal room, call platform,
  etc.), which displays an opt-in AI augmentation widget.

- An onboarding tour presents "how AI assists you in real time" with
  practical examples.

- On first use, the widget asks for notification and context
  permissions.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User enters or is detected in a live, high-pressure
  interaction (e.g., sales call, crisis command, deal review).

  - AI passively listens and monitors data feeds and communications.

  - If approaching a bottleneck (rapid info flow, memory pressure), the
    AI silently triggers detection workflows in the background.

- **Step 2:** If a bottleneck is detected, the AI immediately delivers a
  "Contextual Assist" popup.

  - Visuals: non-intrusive notification or sidebar with AI service
    suggestions (e.g., "Recall Last 3 Decisions," "Relevant Contract
    Clause," or "Past Pattern").

  - Clicks or keystrokes invoke detailed context (e.g., full transcript,
    summary of related events, pattern matches).

- **Step 3:** User tracks transcription on a floating overlay, with
  real-time highlights for possible missed points, incomplete ideas, or
  jargon requiring clarification.

  - These highlights update live as AI recognizes "gaps" or patterns.

- **Step 4:** User can share, bookmark, or export AI suggestions and
  transcripts for team review.

  - Optional: User can disable, snooze, or customize assist types per
    session.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Priority escalation: If multiple users/streams are active, system
  prioritizes bottlenecks closest to task-critical deadlines.

- Graceful degradation: If throughput is maxed, critical cues are
  prioritized; non-critical popups deferred.

- Full-text/summarization fallback: If memory or pattern match is
  ambiguous, UI prompts for feedback/improvement.

- Multilingual and accessibility support (ARIA, color contrast, keyboard
  shortcuts).

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Minimal disruption: All prompts are context-sensitive and
  non-blocking.

- Fast feedback: Users can quickly rate AI suggestions ("Spot On" or
  "Missed Context") to continuously improve service.

- Widget is draggable, resizable, and mobile-compatible.

## Narrative

A global operations lead monitors a taskforce managing real-time
incident escalation calls. In fast-moving situations, team members often
forget key past decisions or lose track of important facts. With the
Cognitive Augmentation Layer enabled, as soon as the conversation
becomes dense or frantic, the system detects cognitive load and memory
bottlenecks through speech rate and query density.

The AI instantly surfaces contextual memory (e.g., "Remember: we solved
a similar issue on December 5th using the Delta Protocol"), while also
running real-time transcription with less than 1% error rate. As the Ops
Lead speaks, a non-intrusive popup recommends an immediate recall of
relevant action items. The team never misses a critical fact, reducing
decision time by half and preventing escalation errors. During review,
the lead observes a timeline showing exactly where decisions sped up and
where AI aids were triggered. User feedback on "keeping up" is
overwhelmingly positive, and the business documents major efficiency
gains.
