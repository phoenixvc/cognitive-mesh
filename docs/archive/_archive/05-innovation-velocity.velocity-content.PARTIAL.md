**Opportunities:**

- Cross-widget sharing: Direct linking from Champion Discovery to Peer
  Q&A.

- Extensible manifest: Widget registry enables plug-in architecture for
  new modules.

- Aggregated status: Unified notification panel for all widget-driven
  events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

**Persona 1: Team Leader**

- Must: As a team leader, I want to see a real-time Champion Discovery
  panel so that I can connect to experts in my domain.

  - Acceptance: Given I open the dashboard, when I access Champion
    Discovery, then I will see a list of top contributors based on
    recent activity, 100% of the time.

- Should: As a team leader, I want to visualize team health via
  Community Pulse so that I can proactively address cultural risk.

  - Acceptance: Given I view Community Pulse, when engagement drops
    below threshold, then I receive a warning prompt.

**Persona 2: Community Member**

- Must: As a user, I want widgets to always restore my layout across
  sessions for seamless workflow.

  - Acceptance: Given a saved widget layout, when I reload the
    dashboard, then my arrangement is restored 100%.

- Must: As a user, I want approval/consent dialogs whenever the widget
  suggests sharing my data or input.

  - Acceptance: Given any outbound data use, when action is triggered,
    then a clear consent dialog appears before proceeding.

**Persona 3: Facilitator**

- Should: As a facilitator, I want to prompt innovation spread and
  knowledge exchange among new joiners.

  - Acceptance: Given a new user joins, when they first access the
    dashboard, then a knowledge exchange widget appears and requests an
    initial contribution.

**Edge Cases & Human-in-the-Loop**

- Must: Given widget API failure, when a user accesses a widget, then
  last-fetched data is shown with an error banner and retry option.

- Must: Given credential or consent revocation, when a widget requests
  protected action, then a notification and resolution path is
  presented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Widget Management (Must)**

  - Registration, drag/drop, resize, pin, remove; persistent layout per
    user.

- **Champion Discovery (Must)**

  - Display of top champions, filter/search, quick connect, association
    with contributions.

- **Community Pulse (Must)**

  - Health meter, engagement/psych-safety score, real-time status,
    actionable feedback.

- **Learning Catalyst (Must)**

  - Curated opportunities, call-to-action overlays, link to resources
    and mentors.

- **Innovation Spread (Should)**

  - Viral flow indicators, trending ideas, and one-click
    share/endorsement tools.

- **Knowledge Exchange (Should)**

  - Peer Q&A, solution upvote/mark-resolved, live discussion
    integration.

- **Approval/Consent UX (Must)**

  - Modal dialogs, provenance badges, and history log of all
    approvals/denials.

- **Error/Offline Handling (Must)**

  - Cached display, error banners, explicit data age; fallback to
    offline state.

- **Accessibility & i18n (Must/Should)**

  - Conformance to WCAG 2.1 AA, language toggling, readable overlays,
    ARIA labeling.

- **Metrics/Observability Layer (Must)**

  - Log all user actions, engagement, error, and consent events to
    backend telemetry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the mesh dashboard after SSO login.

- First-time users are greeted by an onboarding carousel, introducing
  widget concepts, privacy, and customization.

- Prominent “Add Widget”/“Customize Dashboard” call-to-action enables
  rapid discovery.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User lands on dashboard.

  - Widgets load asynchronously with loading skeletons.

  - Simultaneous backend calls fetch champion, pulse, and learning data.

- **Step 2:** User customizes widgets (drag/drop/pin/remove).

  - Each action is persisted to user profile and gives instant visual
    feedback.

- **Step 3:** User interacts with widget content (viewing champions,
  pulse, resources).

  - Provenance sources shown for all data; hover/chip overlays for
    details.

  - Immediate actions (Q&A, request mentorship, endorse idea) are
    available in each widget.

- **Step 4:** Consent/approval flows.

  - Any action requiring data share or org-wide impact triggers a modal
    approval dialog.

  - Action only proceeds after explicit user approval.

- **Step 5:** Handling failures.

  - Widget displays last-fetched (cached) data, expiration badge, and a
    retry button.

  - Banner explains backend unavailability or error.

- **Step 6:** Session end or reload.

  - Layout, pinned widgets, and preferences auto-restore.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can export widget settings or share layouts.

- On repeated backend error, widgets compress into notification panel
  with error summary.

- If consent is revoked, previously shared data is flagged for
  review/removal.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- High-contrast color schemes and large clickable targets.

- Overlay modals are keyboard and screen reader accessible.

- Responsive layout on desktop and mobile/tablet.

- Tooltips explain provenance, consent, and innovation metrics.

- All notifications are concise, actionable, and dismissible.

**Sample Diagrams:**

- Widget Load Sequence (user triggers → async API requests → backend
  response → UI render)

- Consent/Approval Flow (user action → modal → user approves/denies →
  backend logs consent)

- Error/Offline State (backend failure → cached content → error banner →
  user retry)

## Narrative

When Maya, a team leader, logs into the Cognitive Mesh dashboard, she’s
greeted by real-time highlights: the top contributors driving innovation
in her group, a pulse reading of community energy, and a “Learning
Catalyst” widget showing peer experiments and resources. With a few
drags and pins, Maya tailors her interface—pushing the champions panel
front and center, while tucking knowledge exchange next to her pulse
meter.

When she uncovers a new process breakthrough in innovation spread, the
widget surfaces a one-click pathway to share, with a consent dialog
giving her full control. Even when her connection drops, Maya’s
dashboard persists, flagging data age but never breaking her flow. Every
action is logged, every consent recorded, and every UI step is
accessible to her whole team. This mesh-native, human-first experience
not only ramps up her team’s performance but makes her feel seen, safe,
and empowered as a leader in an always-on, connected organization.
