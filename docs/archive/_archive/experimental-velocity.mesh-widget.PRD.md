# Experimental Velocity Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered)

### TL;DR

Experimental Velocity widgets transform how teams interact with
innovation: instant recalibration, theater detection, and experiment
analytics, powered by mesh backend APIs. The hexagonal structure ensures
robust ports and adapters, resilient offline/error behavior, accessible
theming, and airtight contract-driven integration—delivering actionable
velocity insights to every dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Drastically accelerate innovation cycles by surfacing real-time
  recalibration and experimentation signals to every user.

- Eliminate “innovation theater” by making real progress, not process,
  visible and actionable.

- Empower product owners and teams to benchmark themselves against
  industry velocity standards.

### User Goals

- Users receive instant feedback on project timelines and feasibility,
  informed by AI-powered recalibration.

- Stakeholders see clear, actionable warnings when projects drift into
  “theater” (all plan, no prototype).

- Teams visualize their experimental capacity trends and take pride in
  capacity leaps.

- Developers and managers have dependable access in any network
  condition, with informative error handling.

- All users benefit from universally accessible, themed, and
  contractually validated widget displays.

### Non-Goals

- No backend data storage or ML logic within the widget (delegated to
  backend API/mesh).

- No business rule calculation in the frontend—always via backend
  contract APIs.

- Does not replace core team/project management or non-mesh dashboards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Product Owner**

- As a Product Owner, I want visual recalibration feedback immediately
  when estimates drift by more than 10%, so that I can re-plan and
  challenge my team in the moment.

- As a Product Owner, I want an actionable notification when the system
  detects "innovation theater" in my project, so I can intervene.

**Developer/Team Member**

- As a Developer, I want to access experiment capacity analytics even
  while offline, so that I can continue to improve our workflow without
  API access.

- As a Developer, I want a clear error or warning if the widget cannot
  sync, so I’m never left guessing if data is stale.

**Executive**

- As an Executive, I want a competitive benchmarking banner that shows
  our team’s velocity compared to sector leaders, so I can track
  organizational health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Velocity Recalibration Widget** (Priority: Must)

  - Receives project/proposal context via WidgetLifecyclePort.

  - Calls DataAPIAdapterPort for recalibrated estimate; displays delta
    and challenge recommendations.

  - Acceptance: Given backend response in \<200ms, must visually update
    in \<350ms.

- **Innovation Theater Detection Panel** (Priority: Must)

  - Consumes theater flags; provides explainers and one-click escalation
    to project owner.

  - Acceptance: Must render banner if backend returns theater=true.

- **Experimental Capacity Tracker** (Priority: Should)

  - Trends and visualizes experiment throughput and deltas over time.

  - Downloads/caches last 30 days of data for offline charting.

- **Competitive Reality Widget** (Priority: Should)

  - Shows our org's experimental velocity versus mesh and sector
    averages.

- **Consent & Provenance Logging** (Priority: Must)

  - Surfaces explicit provenance banner on first load, tracks user
    consent/approvals for all actionable widgets.

- **Telemetry & Feedback** (Priority: Must)

  - Logs all user actions, widget errors, and feedback for observability
    and continuous improvement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users discover widgets on the main dashboard or via team boards;
  initial onboarding summarizes recalibration and experiment tracking
  purpose.

- Onboarding dialog requests API permission and user consent for
  telemetry.

- Widget preview mode available for new users, with sample/demo data.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Dashboard renders widget container in user’s context.

  - Detects theme and localization context.

  - Confidentiality/provenance banner shown on first use.

- **Step 2:** WidgetLifecyclePort receives proposal/project context
  event.

  - Minimal latency between dashboard and widget initialization.

- **Step 3:** Calls DataAPIAdapterPort, fetches
  recalibration/theater/capacity data from mesh backend.

  - If successful, widget visually updates with highlighted changes.

  - If error/state is stale, displays “offline” mode with last-known
    good data and retry button.

- **Step 4:** User interacts—triggers recalibration, reads theater
  flags, reviews capacity chart.

  - Actionable icons for escalation, drill-down, or feedback.

- **Step 5:** All actions, lifecycle events, errors logged via
  TelemetryPort.

- **Step 6:** Periodic sync with backend until widget or dashboard is
  destroyed.

  - Handles theme changes, context switches, and widget reordering
    seamlessly.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can “pin” widgets, configure custom thresholds for
  recalibration alerts, and opt into beta analytics features.

- If backend API is version-incompatible, widget refuses to load and
  provides actionable user feedback with details.

- If cache is \>7 days old, widget requests explicit user
  refresh/consent before displaying stale data.

- If theme/contrast access is revoked or unavailable, widget falls back
  to system theme.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All widgets maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.

- Fully keyboard-navigable, with focus ring highlighting, skip-links,
  and role/ARIA labeling.

- Responsive layout for all dashboard configurations (desktop, large
  display, mobile preview).

- Widget theming/internationalization changes reflected within 1s of
  dashboard context switch.

## Narrative

Innovators at every level—product owners rapidly prototyping, developers
eager for testable ideas, executives demanding real transformation—all
struggle with the invisible drag of outdated cycles and ineffective
activities dubbed “innovation theater.” With the Experimental Velocity
Mesh Widgets, the organization’s dashboard no longer hides these issues.
Now, recalibration signals surface within moments: outdated estimates
are flagged, theater is called out, and the success of genuine
experimentation is celebrated in statistical clarity. The experience is
frictionless and accessible—adapted to every device, network, and
theme—ensuring that whenever a project hits a snag or a team’s velocity
soars, all stakeholders see, understand, and can act on it instantly.
Uniting backend logic and resilient frontend, these widgets help every
user break through legacy inertia—transforming intent into rapid,
validated action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- Time-to-first-feedback: Median duration from dashboard load to first
  recalibration/theater signal surfaced (\<500ms goal).

- Offline usage: % of users successfully viewing cached capacity
  analytics during outage.

- Accessibility pass rate: % of widget sessions with zero a11y
  violations detected via automated test suite.

### Business Metrics

- Experimentation velocity uplift: % increase in experiments-per-sprint
  post-widget rollout.

- Reduction in “unproductive” cycles: Fewer initiative flagged as
  ‘theater’ after 3 sprints.

- User engagement: Dwell time and action rate in widget area.

### Technical Metrics

- API contract test pass rate (widget/backend): \>99.9% on main.

- Widget crash/error report rate: \<0.1% sessions.

- Sync latency (API to widget render): \<350ms 95th percentile.

### Tracking Plan

- Widget load and user click/focus events

- Backend API call and response timing

- Error/fallback/“offline” mode triggers

- Theme switch and a11y detection events

- Feedback and escalation actions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Strictly typed TypeScript interface for widget core (ports, adapters,
  models).

- Integration with mesh backend via OpenAPI-driven API client
  (DataAPIAdapterPort).

- IndexedDB/localStorage caching for offline and stale-data fallback.

- Telemetry, feedback, and error handling through separate outbound
  ports.

### Integration Points

- Mesh dashboard shell (WidgetLifecyclePort, RendererAdapter).

- OpenAPI contract—CI pipeline fails on version drift.

- Mesh-wide telemetry and error logging API.

- Consent and provenance management infrastructure.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All widget state is session/local cached—no persistent PII or usage
  data locally.

- Consent and provenance strictly surfaced as required by organizational
  policy.

- All user-initiated actions logged against user session for
  trace/audit.

### Scalability & Performance

- Widget must function across millions of dashboard loads; supports
  hot/cold code splitting for performance.

- Caching TTLs adjustable via dashboard settings.

### Potential Challenges

- API schema drift or mesh contract versioning mismatch.

- Handling abrupt theme/context changes without visual flicker.

- Maintaining robust offline-first and recovery capability at scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium: 2–4 weeks initial build (core widgets, ports, adapters, test
  harness); 1–2 weeks post-launch iteration.

### Team Size & Composition

- Small Team: 1-2 people—Product (specs/testing) and Engineering
  (frontend, contract/integration).
