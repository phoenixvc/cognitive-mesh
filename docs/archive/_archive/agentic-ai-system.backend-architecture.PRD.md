# Agentic AI System Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Agent Registry)

### TL;DR

Cognitive Mesh backend natively orchestrates agentic AI systems with
first-class support for autonomy, authority, and agency. Every port and
adapter explicitly models these agent properties, while a unified Agent
Registry governs lifecycle, permissioning, and auditing. System is
designed for enterprise-grade compliance and high-velocity agent
evolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Enable seamless multi-agent orchestration with fine-grained control
  over autonomy/authority for regulated enterprises

- Provide transparent, auditable agent lifecycle management to satisfy
  compliance teams

- Allow rapid onboarding of new agent capabilities with no service
  interruption

- Ensure operational trust and reputational protection via bulletproof
  audit/oversight flows

### User Goals

- Grant users confidence to hand off complex tasks to autonomous agents
  with adjustable oversight

- Provide admins with simple tools to review, authorize, and override
  agentic operations in real time

- Empower engineering teams to safely extend mesh system with 3rd party
  or custom agents

- Surface clear, actionable agent logs, notifications, and error
  reporting for all stakeholders

### Non-Goals

- Building a complete agent execution engine (assume agents run on
  external services/invoked APIs)

- Implementing frontend UI (covered by mesh widgets and agent control
  center)

- Custom agent/skill authoring or marketplace (focus is on backend
  orchestration, not end-user customization tools)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Mesh Admin**

- As a Mesh Admin, I want to register and configure agents with defined
  authority boundaries, so our org’s data/processes never exceed policy.

- As a Mesh Admin, I want to receive real-time alerts if any agent
  attempts out-of-scope or high-risk actions, so I can intervene before
  issues escalate.

- As a Mesh Admin, I want to retire/roll-forward agent versions, so our
  mesh only contains compliant, approved agent logic.

- As a Mesh Admin, I want to audit step-by-step agent actions and see
  who/what had final authority at every point.

**Persona: Business User**

- As a Business User, I want to delegate problems or workflows to mesh
  agents and get results without specifying low-level steps.

- As a Business User, I want clear notifications when agent authority is
  required and instructions for granting or denying consent.

- As a Business User, I want confidence that any autonomous actions are
  audit logged and can be reviewed later.

**Persona: Compliance Auditor**

- As a Compliance Auditor, I want to review all agentic decisions,
  authority escalations, and consent events with full details.

- As a Compliance Auditor, I want to receive notifications of agent
  sunset or registry changes for regulatory tracking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Agent Registry & Governance (Priority: Must)**

  - AgentRegistryPort: Register, retire, and query agent
    identity/capability (OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1registry).

  - Must enumerate all agents with autonomy/agency/authority fields.

  - Must return current/previous versions and status (active,
    deprecated, retired).

  - G/W/T: Given network/DB outage, When any registry op fails, Then
    error envelope is surfaced and request is queued for retry.

- **Agent Orchestration & Execution (Priority: Must)**

  - AgentOrchestrationPort: Accepts user-submitted problems and
    orchestrates agent/multi-agent workflow (OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1orchestrate).

  - Must trigger the correct agent in \<200ms and log all steps, with
    user, agentId, autonomy/authority, and final outcome.

  - G/W/T: If agent attempts unauthorized or risky action, port blocks,
    surfaces the reason to user, and logs escalation.

  - G/W/T: On orchestration engine offline, batch and retry within SLA
    or escalate to admin.

- **Authority & Consent Management (Priority: Should)**

  - AuthorityPort: Real-time query and override for agent
    permission/scope (OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1authority).

  - Should support policy-based authority templates.

  - ConsentPort: For high-scope or sensitive actions, user/admin consent
    must be flow-gated, logged, and held before execution.

  - G/W/T: On consent failure or denial, agent must halt, surface clear
    message, and store failed-attempt event.

- **Audit Logging, Event & Notification (Priority: Must)**

  - All agent actions, registry changes, escalations, and consent events
    logged to event bus with {agentId, action, user, params, timestamp}
    (OpenAPI: /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11event~1log).

  - NotificationAdapter must send real-time alert to admins and/or users
    on failure, escalation, or high-authority action.

  - G/W/T: On audit service error, must queue events with retry/backoff;
    notify on persistent failure.

- **Uniform Error Envelope, Retry, and Circuit Policy (Priority: Must)**

  - All adapters return error envelope: { error_code, message,
    correlationID, agentId }

  - Backoff: 250ms initial, doubles to 1s, ±50ms jitter, max 3 attempts
    before queueing to batch fallback.

  - Circuit breaker resets after 10 healthy cycles.

  - G/W/T: If registry or core port offline beyond max retries, flag in
    status dashboard and escalate.

- **Deprecation & Governance (Priority: Must)**

  - n–1 support for all port contracts.

  - All breaking changes: 90-day advance warning, automated
    registry/email alert, tracked with sunset issue in project repo.

  - Agent version drift or shadowing auto-triggers admin review and
    registry block.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Mesh Admins access backend dashboard, authenticate with SSO.

- Admins review the Agent Registry list: view all agents, capabilities,
  authority, status (active/deprecated/retired).

- For onboarding, step-by-step wizard guides registration: set agentId,
  define autonomy/agency/authority variables, attach
  contact/notification, save.

- Users submit problems/work via API, routed to orchestration pipeline.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Business User/Widget submits a “problem” (e.g., “Resolve
  this customer complaint”) to AgentOrchestrationPort.

  - API validates request, fetches suitable agent profile from registry.

  - If agent autonomy/authority covers action, or consent is on file,
    proceed.

- **Step 2:** Agent executes, logs {agentId, autonomy, action, user,
  timestamp} for every step.

  - If agent requests elevated authority, AuthorityPort consults
    policy—may require admin approval via ConsentPort.

  - Outcome (pass/fail/error) logged and notified to relevant user/admin
    as per config.

- **Step 3:** User or admin can query AgentRegistryPort to review all
  decision, escalation, and error records.

  - Downloadable audit report provided for compliance teams.

- **Step 4:** On agent version update or policy change, registry applies
  migration, triggers sunset notification if needed.

- **Step 5:** If agent action fails, error envelope and recommended next
  steps are returned to API clients and surfaced via
  NotificationAdapter.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Registry outage: All requests queued and retried per policy; admin
  notified if outage exceeds 1 minute.

- Agent authority violation: Immediate halt, event logged, auto-approval
  blocked, and alert to admin dashboard.

- ConsentPort workflow: “High-risk” or “sensitive” operations must be
  held until explicit admin/user approval.

- Schema drift/version mismatch: API and registry auto-reject requests
  with incorrect payload; error envelope received and dashboard
  notification surfaced.

- Circuit breaker: If any adapter/offline event exceeds retry attempts,
  mark agent as degraded, surface UI indicator, log, and alert on
  recovery.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Consistent error/approval/consent overlays: identical visual language
  for “Retry,” “Consent Needed,” and “Escalation” across all
  integrations (documented in mini pattern library).

- Accessibility-first notifications, clear “agent acting” banners, and
  inline status icons for quick audit.

- Auto-disable or graceful fallback for monitored a11y violations in
  user-facing controls.

## Narrative

At a leading multinational enterprise, work is accelerating—and so is
complexity. Previously, every new challenge demanded a custom solution,
a custom workflow, or a manual hand-off. But now, teams can simply state
their business problem and rely on the Cognitive Mesh to dynamically
orchestrate not just one, but many AI agents acting with the appropriate
authority, autonomy, and supervision.

As the system scales, admins gain confidence: every agent is catalogued,
its power carefully defined, consent enforced, and all decisions logged
to the millisecond. From registration and onboarding, to runtime
delegation, to audit and oversight, the backend architecture now
empowers the business to deploy AI faster—with trust, compliance, and
operational resilience built in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

- % of agent actions completed autonomously without manual intervention

- User/Admin satisfaction scores on ease of oversight and trust in agent
  logs

### Business Metrics

- Time saved per workflow after agentic mesh rollout vs. baseline

- Number of workflows successfully migrated to agentic orchestration

- Reduction of agent error/escalation/rollback events vs. traditional
  process

### Technical Metrics

- P99 latency for orchestration (goal \<200ms)

- Uptime/availability of registry and ports (\>99.99%)

- Audit event throughput and data retention SLA compliance

- Number of version drift or schema mismatch issues per release

### Tracking Plan

- Agent registration, update, retire events

- OrchestrationPort: new problem submission, agent invocation,
  escalation, fail

- AuthorityPort: scope query, override, denial, consent capture

- Audit log append and query events

- Notification and alert triggers

- CI/CD gating on simulated error/edge/batch retry paths

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Stateless, horizontally scalable port adapters

- AgentRegistry with strongly consistent, event-sourced backend

- AuthN/AuthZ for all ports; SSO integration

## 2. Agent Registry, Port Contracts, and G/W/T

- **AgentRegistryPort**

  - Must: Register, retire, update, and query agent and capabilities

    - OpenAPI: /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1registry

  - G/W/T: If agent is missing required attributes (autonomy/authority),
    request fails with error envelope. Must handle batch registry
    update. Offline =\> batch/queue with alert.

- **AgentOrchestrationPort**

  - Must: Accepts user problems, invokes agent(s), logs each invocation

    - OpenAPI: /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1orchestrate

  - G/W/T: Given agent unavailable, When workflow triggered, Then agent
    fail event logged, error envelope returned, alternative suggested.

- **AuthorityPort**

  - Should: Query or override agent authority in real-time

    - OpenAPI: /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1authority

  - G/W/T: On override conflict, surface error and halt agent action
    with clear audit trail.

- **ConsentPort**

  - Must: Flow-gate user/admin consent for high-risk or new-agent
    operations

    - OpenAPI: /docs/spec/agentic-ai.yaml#/paths/1v11agent~1consent

  - G/W/T: On consent denied, agent execution halted, audit record
    created, user notified.

- **All Adapters**

  - Must: Standardized error/edge/timeout/offline handling

  - G/W/T: On error, use error envelope, backoff and retry, queue to
    batch if needed.

  - G/W/T: On circuit breaker open, degrade gracefully, notify
    admin/user and log.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Error Envelope, Retry, and Lifecycle

- All responses: { error_code, message, correlationID, agentId }

- Retry: 250ms initial interval, doubles to 1s, ±50ms jitter, max 3
  before batch to retry process

- Circuit breaker: open after 3 consecutive fails, reset after 10
  healthy cycles

- Offline handling: queue all failed actions for later processing if
  registry/event bus is unreachable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. State, Audit Logging, Compliance

- All agentic actions, authority changes, escalations, user/admin
  overrides, and consent events log agentId, timestamp, action, params,
  and outcome

- Multi-tenant isolation of logs and registry data

- Event bus aggregates for full traceability; all logs retrievable in
  \<1s via query

- SOC2, GDPR, and retention/erasability built in
