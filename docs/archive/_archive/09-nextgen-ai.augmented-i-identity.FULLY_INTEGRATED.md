# Augmented-I Identity Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Sharpened)

### TL;DR

Backend for identity and mindset augmentation in Cognitive Mesh,
transforming professionals from "AI tool users" to "Augmented-I" humans.
All business logic, API contracts, error envelopes, and consent flows
are universally testable with Given/When/Then acceptance, directly
mapped to Foundation, Reasoning, BusinessApps, and Agency layers.
Includes exact OpenAPI fragments, diagram library, test harness,
explicit governance, CI, and managed deprecation/change cycles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Deliver a robust, composable system for identity transformation, from
  "uses AI" to "is augmented by AI."

- Accelerate professional adoption and value creation through measurable
  mindset and behavioral shift.

- Drive organizational competitiveness by embedding augmentation, bias
  detection, and anti-recklessness at every knowledge worker level.

- Ensure all data flows, consent, and review are governance- and
  audit-ready for HR and compliance teams.

### User Goals

- Users evolve their professional identity and operate from a default of
  "Augmented-I" (not just "uses AI tools").

- Individuals and orgs receive real-time feedback/coaching on
  augmentation journey and reckless non-adoption.

- Consent, privacy, and review controls are transparent and accessible
  to every user.

- Users clearly see their F-Scale (Fear → Fun) stage and receive
  next-action coaching within their workflow.

### Non-Goals

- Does not provide user-facing widget/frontend code (see separate PRD).

- Not designed for consumer/gaming or non-professional chat
  applications.

- Does not replace corporate HR compliance platforms—integrates/gates as
  needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona 1: Knowledge Worker**

- As a knowledge worker, I want to see my current augmentation/F-Scale
  status, so that I know how "Augmented-I" I am becoming.

- As a knowledge worker, I want prompts and nudges that accelerate my
  move from fear/familiarity to fluency/fun, so that I'm increasingly
  competitive and confident.

- As a knowledge worker, I want to understand where I'm being "reckless"
  in not using augmentation, so I can improve.

- As a knowledge worker, I want all my data, augmentation assessments,
  and HR flags to be transparent and manually reviewable.

**Persona 2: HR/Org Reviewer**

- As an HR reviewer, I want to review flagged cases of reckless
  non-augmentation, so that only fair and bias-checked actions are
  taken.

- As an HR reviewer, I want auditable logs of all augmentation, consent,
  and review actions, so that we remain in compliance.

**Persona 3: Chief Augmentation Officer**

- As a Chief Augmentation Officer, I want organization-wide dashboards
  of augmentation bias/distribution, so I can create action plans.

- As a Chief Augmentation Officer, I want to assign, gate, and review
  "augmentation milestones" and reflex adoption rates per team or user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

### Core Mesh Features (All Priority: Must unless stated)

- **IdentityIntegrationPort (REST/gRPC)**

  - Returns: user's full augmentation/F-Scale/Journey/bias status

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11identity-integration~1post

  - Given a valid profile, when requested, then respond in \<200ms with
    augmented status (cf. schema) and bias metric

  - On malformed: respond 400/error; log correlationID

  - G/W/T for both normal/edge/bad-payload/circuit open

- **MindsetEmbeddingPort (REST/gRPC)**

  - Returns: current F-Scale (Fear/Familiar/Fluent/Fun), next-target
    reflex or mindset question, recent bias evolution

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11mindset-embedding~1post

  - Given current journey usage pattern, when queried, then provide
    F-Scale and coaching message (in \<250ms)

  - Edge: Stuck state (never progresses past Familiar), must prompt for
    intervention

  - Offline: cache last skill level; "retry" triggers fresh fetch.

- **NonAugmentationDetectionPort**

  - Returns: reckless status (boolean), non-augmentation bias (float
    0–1), and rationale

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11reckless-detection~1post

  - Given workflow/task, when analyzed, then return bias metric \[0–1\],
    flag if under policy threshold, respond in \<150ms.

  - Acceptance: Edge case (refuses to shift from 0); must flag for
    review.

- **ChiefAugmentationFrameworkPort**

  - Returns: org bias distribution, CAO role status, competitive
    benchmarks

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11chief-augmentation~1post

  - Non-critical (Should): Given org context, return latest CAO metrics;
    on HR flag or schema drift, lock and prompt manual review.

- **ConsentPort / ManualReviewPort / HRReviewPort**

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11manual-review~1post

  - All critical org/HR-affecting events must be gated by a consent
    check, with explicit audit and admin unlock for flagged cases.

  - G/W/T: On consent denied, no change written; event flagged and
    visible in API & logs.

- **NotificationAdapter (Event, Webhook)**

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/NotificationEvent

  - Must: Given identity, mindset, or augmentation event, when
    processed, then notify subscribed listeners in \<1s and log
    correlationID.

  - Circuit-break: fallback to queuing if \>3 failures in 1m; log; reset
    on 2 healthy cycles.

- **AuditLoggingAdapter**

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AuditLogEntry

  - Must: Given any change/event/review, when received, then record
    within 2s (with user ID, schema ID, correlationID).

  - Error: On DB fail, queue to batch; retry 3x with exp.
    backoff+jitter.

- **EventAdapter (gRPC, etc.)**

  - OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AugmentationEvent

  - Must: Same G/W/T logic; all events timestamped, provenance signed,
    and retriable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users provisioned with default "neutral" augmentation identity and
  F-Scale stage "Familiar."

- On first API call, journey onboarding: system explains the
  "Augmented-I" concept and F-Scale. Admins receive a setup onboarding
  guide.

**Core Experience**

- Step 1: User/Org connects system; syncs with IdentityIntegrationPort
  and receives current augmentation/self status.

- Step 2: Regular background analysis via MindsetEmbeddingPort and
  NonAugmentationDetectionPort detects journey progression and bias
  evolution.

- Step 3: On notable event (reckless detected, F-Scale jump),
  NotificationAdapter pushes update to user(s) and logs for review.

- Step 4: Any HR-critical event triggers ConsentPort, escalates to
  HRReviewPort/ManualReviewPort if needed; no org/bias change until
  admin signoff.

- Step 5: AuditLoggingAdapter records all status changes, feedback, and
  unlocks.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Consent denied: user receives automated and human escalation; system
  "locks" further recommendations/changes until resolved.

- Edge: Biased stuck at 0 or 1 (total non-aug or only-AI); prompts for
  review/intervention.

- Schema drift: If API mismatch, system disables API for affected
  client/service and instructs on upgrade.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All API surfaces and responses must carry traceable correlationID.

- All actions and recommendations are time-stamped, reason-stated, and
  logged for audit purposes.

- Error messages and "locked" states are human-readable and actionable
  for both users and admins.

- WCAG accessibility and i18n ready for any surfaced error messages
  through widget.

## Narrative

A seasoned analyst at a leading tech firm finds herself at a crossroads:
her competition is increasingly augmented by AI, and her old methods lag
in both speed and insight. Instead of adding yet another tool, her
company rolls out Augmented-I—a backend framework built into their core
systems. She logs in for the first time and sees a personalized journey
map, nudges that recognize when she's merely "using AI as a tool," and
prompts that help her habitually ask, "How can Augmented-I do this
better?" Over the next weeks, her professional identity and skills
evolve measurably—she's not just using augmentation, she is augmented.
HR and management see this shift ripple across teams, with governance,
audit, and manual review always in place. The company pulls ahead of
competitors with an adaptable, future-proof workforce. The outcomes:
elevated employee confidence, organization-wide competitive gain, and
auditable, compliant augmentation for every knowledge worker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- % users progressing at least one F-Scale stage per quarter

- % users with bias rising towards "Augmented-I" (e.g., bias \> 0.75)

- % users who receive targeted nudges and respond within 48 hours

- % users who actively review/resolve "reckless" flags

### Business Metrics

- Org-level increase in workflow velocity as measured by pre/post
  F-Scale and bias metrics

- % reduction in HR/Compliance interventions due to system-driven audit
  and consent gates

- Reduction in employee churn attributable to increased augmentation

### Technical Metrics

- SLA adherence (see Service NFR)

- Successful completion of all compliance/audit log events in \<2s 99.9%

- API error envelope, contract, and schema evolution pass in CI 100%

- Zero API drift (all adapters validated to CI agile contract suite
  before merge)

### Tracking Plan

- Identity/F-Scale progression events

- Bias metric changes/submissions

- Consent granted/denied actions and resolution times

- All manual review unlocks and schema versioned changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- API definition and contract enforcement via OpenAPI YAML

- Trusted service mesh for secure cross-layer communication
  (REST/gRPC/event)

- Data store for identity state, bias progress, and audit logs

- Circuit-breaker, backoff, caching, and error envelope logic per
  port/adapter

### Integration Points

- HRIS/Compliance for consent/review hooks

- Widget/frontend PRD for all user-surfaced actions

- Data export hooks for audit, compliance, and analytics tools

### Data Storage & Privacy

- PII and augmentation state must be encrypted at rest and in transit

- All HR/consent decisions stored with full audit trail and manual
  unlock only

- Regional compliance (GDPR, etc.) enforced via FoundationLayer storage
  config

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 10k+ simultaneous users with live augmentation
  state/notifications

- Multi-region failover for FoundationLayer storage and notification;
  SLOs enforce low-latency and full DR

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring API contracts and schemas evolve without drift/compatibility
  gaps

- Protecting the privacy and rights of users under aggressive
  augmentation/HR paradigms

- Automating manual review/consent processes without increasing
  burden/latency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium (2–4 weeks for MVP, core layer wiring, three key port/adapter
  flows plus CI harness; extension in sprints for full governance,
  consent, org/cao logic)

### Team Size & Composition

- Small Team: 2–3 total people (Product+Backend; optional DevOps for
  CI/DC)

- Phases align with lean, testable releases; each includes one person
  responsible for PRD delivery and milestone demo.

## 2. Ports & Adapters: Prioritization, Contract, Test

All ports/adapters get:

- MoSCoW Priority

- OpenAPI reference (exact JSON Pointer)

- Universal G/W/T scenario

**Key examples:**

- **IdentityIntegrationPort** (Must)

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11identity-integration~1post

  - Given valid identity payload, When received, Then return
    fusion/augmentation metrics in \<200ms.

  - Edge: Given malformed, When handled, Then return 400/error envelope
    ({ error_code: "INVALID_PAYLOAD", ... }).

- **MindsetEmbeddingPort** (Must)

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11mindset-embedding~1post

  - Given current usage pattern, When posted, Then return latest
    F-Scale, reflexes, and nudge in \<250ms.

  - Edge: F-Scale stuck; must trigger escalation.

- **NonAugmentationDetectionPort** (Must)

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11reckless-detection~1post

  - Given workflow, When analyzed, Then return bias and reckless flag,
    edge: stuck at 0 triggers review.

- **NotificationAdapter** (Must)

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/NotificationEvent

  - Given event, When processed, Then update listener in \<1s, log
    correlationID.

  - Edge: On 3 sequential fails, queue and notify admin.

- **AuditLoggingAdapter** (Must)

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AuditLogEntry

  - On fail, retry 3x with specified backoff.

- **ConsentPort (Must)**

  - /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11manual-review~1post

  - On consent denied, event blocked, audit entry created, admin
    notified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Universal G/W/T Scenarios (All Flows)

- **Normal:** Given valid input, when port is called, then respond
  within SLA with correct payload.

- **Edge:** Given bias stuck at 0 (or 1), when detected, then escalate
  to manual review and so notify.

- **Offline:** Given dependency (DB, queue) is down, when port called,
  then persist error, queue, and return user-facing error within SLA.

- **Manual review/consent denied:** Given flagged HR action, when
  consent denied, then event is blocked and must be admin unlocked.

- **Schema mismatch:** Given client schema mismatch, when request sent,
  then respond with error code and user-facing "please update" alert,
  log and alert devops.

- **Circuit open:** Given adapter fails \>3 times in 1 min, when called,
  then auto-disable, queue events, periodic retry.

- **Deprecation:** Given major version is sunset, when deprecated API
  called, then respond with clear error, update guidance, and log usage.

- **Test suite:** All G/W/T inherited as explicit, validated acceptance
  scripts in test harness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. API Contract References & Schema Evolution

**Example Fragments:**

- F-Scale payload:
  /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/FScalePayload

- Notification event:
  /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/NotificationEvent

- Audit log entry:
  /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AuditLogEntry

**Schema evolution:**

- All new fields are clearly tagged "new" in OpenAPI, deprecated fields
  marked "deprecated."

- Only additive changes outside major version.

- Client notification: all breaking changes announced via dev/ops email,
  with migration doc attached.

- Strict "n–1" compatibility guaranteed for all payloads; sunset after
  published, versioned, 90-day window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. State, Caching, Retry, Circuit Policy

- **Caching:** Each port/adapter caches latest { augmentation status,
  F-Scale, bias } for 30m TTL. Invalidated on explicit retry, schema
  update, or user override.

- **Retry:** Exponential backoff: 200ms, 400ms, 800ms (jitter ±100ms),
  Max 3 per event.

- **Fallback:** After 3 fails, fallback event to batch pipeline and
  admin alert; clear notification in UI/logs.

- **Circuit reset:** After 2 healthy cycles, circuit closes and system
  resumes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Visuals: Diagrams Library

- All diagrams in /docs/diagrams/augmented-i/

  - <a href="/docs/diagrams/augmented-i/component.svg" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Component Diagram: component.svg</a>

  - <a href="/docs/diagrams/augmented-i/journey.svg" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">User Journey: journey.svg</a>

  - <a href="/docs/diagrams/augmented-i/consent.svg" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Consent &amp; HR Review:
    consent.svg</a>

  - Acceptance: all new user flows must have SVG/PNG diagram created,
    reviewed, and merged pre-release.

![Journey Diagram](/docs/diagrams/augmented-i/journey.svg)

  

![Consent Diagram](/docs/diagrams/augmented-i/consent.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. CI Pipeline & Test Harness

- **Contract validation:** OpenAPI lint (all ports/adapters, all fields,
  all error envelopes).

- **Performance:** SLA/load tests target 99.9% within SLOs.

- **Error envelope:** Must validate { error_code, message, correlationID
  } in all fail/edge cases.

- **Schema version audit:** All adapters and test harness must accept
  n–1 and current version of every schema.

- **Governance:** Manual review checklist, audit trail, and proven
  notification issued for all "locked" or sunsetting APIs.

- **Test harness suite:**

  - Normal flow

  - Recklessness stuck at 0/1

  - Offline/error handling

  - Consent denied/HR manual review

  - Schema mismatch

  - Circuit open/close

  - Deprecation sunset event

- No CI pass = no merge/deploy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Versioning, Deprecation, Governance Checklist

- **Support:** Always serve n–1 major version live.

- **Deprecation:**

  - Create GitHub issue (label: deprecation, mention all stakeholders).

  - Notify affected team leads via auto-email, Slack ping.

  - 90-day warning window; migration doc required on ticket.

  - Post-X releases, sunset is CI-enforced.

  - On deprecated call: user-facing error, update instructions, log to
    audit.

- **Contract changes:**

  - All migrations documented.

  - Additive fields require notification.

  - Deprecated fields supported for n–1 cycles—validation/test harness
    must cover both old and new schemes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Governance, Consent, & Manual Review

- Every HR- or org-impacting event is gated by explicit consent
  (ConsentPort) and logged to
  /docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AugmentationReviewCase.

- ManualReviewPort is required for unlocking after any denial or flagged
  recklessness/bias.

- AuditLoggingAdapter tracks every change, unlock, and access.

- No org or HR state shift occurs without full unlock and admin
  sign-off; all such actions visible in user-facing API and compliance
  logs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
