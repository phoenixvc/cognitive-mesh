# Cognitive Mesh Adaptive Balance & Continuous Improvement Backend PRD (Multi-Agent, Scaffolding, RMF, Meta-Learning)

### TL;DR

The backend delivers spectrum-adaptive intelligence for every business
and behavioral dimension, orchestrates multi-agent reasoning,
systematically grounds decision-making in reality, and aligns all
learning with evidence-based, NIST RMF-compliant continuous improvement.
Every port and engine is contractually testable, OpenAPI-driven, and
supports dynamic stakeholder and context-aware balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve \>99% error prevention and mitigation for profit-loss and
  identity-drift scenarios

- Deliver evidence-backed, audit-ready compliance for NIST RMF and
  sectoral frameworks by launch

- Reduce commercial logic defects by \>90% versus baseline agent
  architectures

- Accelerate learning cycles and measurable agent improvement rates
  quarter over quarter

- Enable rapid integration and scaling in highly regulated, competitive
  enterprise environments

### User Goals

- Ensure every agent decision is profit-aware, context-appropriate, and
  reality-grounded

- See balance recommendations and context reasoning for all actions—no
  “black box” behaviors

- Rapidly recover or prevent mistakes, with auditable rationale and
  rollback

- Provide feedback that genuinely drives agent/system adaptation over
  time

- Zero tolerance for embarrassing hallucinations or missed commercial
  opportunities

### Non-Goals

- Real-world robotic actions or physical fulfillment (focus is
  digital/AI agent logic only)

- Hard-coded “static” personality or fixed behavioral presets

- Closed-loop learning without human or stakeholder oversight

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**For Business Owner (BO), Operator (OP), and Compliance Officer (CO):**

- As a BO, I want the agent to maximize profit while respecting business
  policies, so my margins are protected without excessive risk.

- As an OP, I want every agent action to reveal its reasoning and
  “balance point” (e.g., profitable but not exploitative, cooperative
  but not naive), so I can trust and tune outcomes.

- As a CO, I want every system decision and learning action to be
  tracked for audit, so I can prove compliance and continuous
  improvement.

- As a BO, I want to prevent the agent from making reality-confused
  decisions or “hallucinations,” so reputation and operations are never
  compromised.

- As an OP, I want to intervene and set guidelines for new scenarios, so
  the system improves rather than repeating errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Adaptive Spectrum Engines** (Priority: Critical)

  - AdaptiveBalancePort: Real-time, spectrum-based recommendations for
    key business/behavioral traits (profit, risk, cooperativeness, etc.)

  - Contract exposes context, both spectrum endpoints, current balance,
    rationale.

- **Multi-Agent & Orchestration** (Priority: Critical)

  - HuggingGPTOrchestrator, Agent2AgentAdapter: Modular “expert” agent
    assignment, dynamic reasoning flows, enterprise-compatible
    protocols.

- **Learning, Reflexion & Preventative Engines** (Priority: Critical)

  - GeneralizedLearningFramework: Pattern recognition, mistake
    prevention, meta-AI skills

  - ReflexionEngine: Self-critique, hallucination detection, 100ms P99
    response.

- **Milestone-Driven Scaffolding** (Priority: High)

  - MilestoneDrivenWorkflow: Defines/executes multi-phase reasoning.
    Pre/post-conditions, rollback steps, mesh propagation.

- **Compliance & Policy Management** (Priority: Critical)

  - NISTMaturityAssessment, EvidenceCollector, legal adapters. G/W/T
    coverage for all statements and events, all mapped to OpenAPI
    pointers; registry and notification hooks.

- **Open Source, Ecosystem, and Meta-Learning** (Priority: High)

  - Integration with LangChain, AgentBench, ReAct, meta-skill ladders
    (PUG-E-ER).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- System admin sets up agent mesh via APIs; chooses key spectrums and
  regulatory settings.

- Upload onboarding data, configure business objectives and regulatory
  needs.

- System generates first balance spectrum dashboards, exposes initial
  API contracts for all ports.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Service receives a decision or task input (e.g.,
  sell/price/evaluate action).

  - Runs profit, identity, and risk spectrum checks via
    AdaptiveBalancePort.

  - Returns both ends of spectrum, context (OpenAPI:
    /docs/spec/balance.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1balance~1get).

  - Explains suggested “balance” along dimension and rationale.

- **Step 2:** Multi-agent Orchestrator composes plan, assigns
  sub-tasks/user stories to experts.

  - Calls internal/external experts as needed (Agent2Agent flows).

- **Step 3:** GeneralizedLearningFramework processes input, runs pattern
  learning, mistake prevention.

  - All outcomes and new lessons are logged, tied to evidence, triggers
    improvement actions.

- **Step 4:** ReflexionEngine audits for self-contradiction or
  hallucination (\<100ms); triggers error overlays and notifications if
  detected; adapts balance automatically.

- **Step 5:** MilestoneDrivenWorkflow checks/advances via defined
  phases.

  - Fails “soft” on unmet pre/post, triggers rollback or learning
    integration to mesh.

- **Step 6:** Compliance engines and notification adapters log all
  decisions, learning events, and failures in registry and trigger
  stakeholder notifications if needed.

- **Step X:** Admins and compliance can fetch full history, audit logs,
  error envelopes, and improvement metrics live.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- System supports soft and hard overrides for “force drift,”
  out-of-range errors, and off-scenario learning (“unknown unknowns”).

- Full offline mode for mesh learning/testing.

- Registry-driven forced migration/upgrade paths with business operator
  sign-off.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Context-exposing feedback for every decision

- Direct spectrum position displayed with rationale and G/W/T for every
  behavioral axis

- All error, override, and drift scenarios are auditable and revertible

- Adaptive overlays for fatigue, compliance, legal, a11y states

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

In the high-stakes world of enterprise automation, commercial AI
failures often stem from one-dimensional thinking—either
over-emphasizing profit or risk, trust or skepticism, compliance or
speed. Our business owner, determined not to repeat history, deploys the
Adaptive Balance Engine, ensuring every decision is
spectrum-aware—optimizing profit, risk, and credibility based on live
data, not preset scripts.

When the system faces a challenging scenario—such as a complex customer
offer or regulatory audit—the orchestration layer dynamically assigns
specialized agents, all monitored by ReflexionEngine for potential
slip-ups or hallucinations. As outcomes unfold, patterns and edge cases
are fed into the GeneralizedLearningFramework, which not only prevents
repeated errors but helps the mesh evolve, learning from each success or
failure.

The result: a business that confidently grows revenue and reputation,
with each agent decision transparent, explainable, and grounded—in both
reality and compliance. Stakeholders and customers alike see measurable,
continuous improvement, driven by a backend that balances adaptability,
learning, and stakeholder trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- % of spectrum-balanced decisions correctly explained to end users

- User feedback scores on trust/transparency of system rationale and
  corrective actions

- Stakeholder satisfaction with outcome tradeoffs (survey/telemetry)

### Business Metrics

- % of high-revenue/profit opportunities correctly captured (versus
  errors/omissions)

- Commercial logic incident reduction (compared to baseline agents)

- Time to deploy new balance spectrum or regulatory rule

### Technical Metrics

- ReflexionEngine hallucination detection: \>99% within 100ms response

- Memory use: AdaptiveBalance/Meta-Learning \<500MB; Milestone API
  \<400ms

- API contract drift/error coverage: \<2% allowed untested drift

- 

### Tracking Plan

- All AdaptiveBalancePort and major API calls (inputs, outputs,
  rationales, spectrum positions)

- Error, override, drift events (with error envelope, correlationID)

- Milestone phase transitions, knowledge propagation

- All policy, compliance, and stakeholder interaction events

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Modular service infrastructure for all engines (reasoning, business
  logic, meta-learning, orchestration)

- Machine-readable OpenAPI contract for every adapter/port (see
  Appendix)

- API traffic routed through explicit error envelope, registry, and
  migration logic

- Live evidence, rollback, and phase-change storage; audit logs for
  every action

### Integration Points

- Connectors for LangChain, AgentBench, sectoral finance/legal APIs,
  registry/notification systems

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Evidence chain stored per transaction; audit/compliance logs
  append-only

- Schema supports full GDPR/AI Act traceability and user
  right-to-be-forgotten controls

### Scalability & Performance

- Scalable by engine/port; concurrency tested under expected load
  (target \<200ms P99 core API response)

- Memory and compute isolated by engine/service, auto-kill/recover on
  resource ceiling

### Potential Challenges

- Contextual spectrum determination across vastly different
  stakeholder/business domains

- Preventing performance regressions with every added adaptation or
  compliance layer

- Automated, real-time rollback while ensuring continuous improvement
  and learning

## 2. Adaptive Balance Engine & Multi-Agent Orchestration

- **Ports:**

  - AdaptiveBalancePort:  
    /docs/spec/balance.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1balance~1get

  - OrchestrationPort:  
    /docs/spec/orchestration.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1orchestrate~1get

  - Agent2AgentAdapter:  
    /docs/spec/agent2agent.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1agent2agent~1communicate

*Sample G/W/T Acceptance Criteria:*

- **Given:** A profit-impacting decision request,

- **When:** AdaptiveBalancePort is called with details,

- **Then:** System must return:

  - Both “profit-max” and “cost-control” ends of spectrum,

  - Recommended context-adjusted balance,

  - Full rationale for choice.

- *OpenAPI:* /docs/spec/balance.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1balance~1get

- **Given:** Agent handoff request from one expert to another,

- **When:** Agent2AgentAdapter is called,

- **Then:** Adapter responds per Google Agent2Agent protocol, with error
  envelope on protocol drift.

All other trait/attribute contracts (e.g., agreeableness, risk) follow
the same pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Advanced Learning & Reflexion Engines

- **GeneralizedLearningFramework:**

## 8. Shared Schemas & Error Envelope Appendix

**Standard Error Envelope Schema**

{ "error_code": "string", "message": "string", "correlationID": "string"
}

All error/exception cases for every contract port, adapter, and learning
event MUST wrap responses in this envelope. Referenced in all G/W/Ts and
OpenAPI schemas.
