# Cognitive Mesh v3 Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Philosophically & Legally Sharpened)

### TL;DR

The Cognitive Mesh v3 backend delivers a globally compliant, culturally
adaptive, and philosophically rigorous multi-agent architecture. With
configurable Cognitive Sandwich phases, advanced sovereignty and
fluency, real-time legal and ethical assurance, and mitigation for
productivity and fatigue, it supports organizations seeking auditable,
human-centric, and research-ready AI deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Accelerate secure and ethical AI deployment for enterprises across
  regions and sectors.

- Achieve end-to-end legal and cultural compliance (GDPR, sectoral,
  global) by default.

- Lead the market in auditable human agency, trust, and transparency for
  autonomous systems.

- Enable empirical research and global regulatory readiness in
  operational AI environments.

### User Goals

- Empower users to confidently drive decisions with transparent,
  human-AI collaboration.

- Ensure sovereignty, clear authorship, and "right to explanation"
  throughout all interactions.

- Adapt user experience to culture, sector, and context.

- Deliver predictable, uninterrupted workflows without notification
  fatigue.

### Non-Goals

- No direct implementation of UI or client-side interfaces (handled in
  frontend).

- Not responsible for bespoke integrations outside documented API
  contracts.

- No proprietary lock-in to a particular cloud—Azure native but
  extensible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Enterprise Knowledge Worker (Analyst, Strategist)**

- As a knowledge worker, I want to see which phase of the process I'm in
  and step back when needed, so that I maintain control and authorship
  over the work.

- As a decision-maker, I want to verify that AI suggestions are
  explainable, traceable, and respect my sector's compliance needs, so
  that I can defend decisions to regulators and peers.

- As a global team member, I want the system to match local cultural
  norms in prompts and authority, so that adoption and collaboration
  feel natural.

**Persona: IT Compliance Officer**

- As a compliance officer, I want all choices, consent actions, and
  overrides to be logged with cultural/legal rationale, so that audits
  are easy and risk is minimized.

- As an auditor, I want self-serve access to regulatory and
  philosophical compliance reports for every workflow.

**Persona: Research Lead / Product Owner**

- As a research lead, I want engagement/fatigue/sovereignty data and
  feedback loops embedded in the platform, so that pilot studies and
  continuous improvement are supported.

- As a product owner, I want to adapt the phase workflow (add/remove
  steps, set pre/postconditions) quickly without redeployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Cognitive Sandwich / Workflow Engines** (Priority: Must)

  - Configurable N-phase process (3–7), with pre/postconditions and
    feedback/step-back support.

  - Individual phases (e.g., Human Analysis, AI Processing, Human
    Validation) as modular API endpoints and adapters.

  - SandwichOrchestrator and CognitiveSovereigntyBridge connect
    individual, team, and enterprise level logic.

- **Philosophical & Ethical Engines** (Priority: Must)

  - NormativeAgencyEngine (Brandom): Ensures reasoning traceability,
    discursive integrity, and epistemic control in all agent/human
    cycles.

  - InformationEthicsEngine (Floridi): Protects informational dignity,
    reversibility, and user control, with audits at each output stage.

- **Fluency & Sovereignty Layer** (Priority: Must)

  - FluencySovereigntyModel, TransitionManager, CognitiveLoadMonitor:

    - All phase and mode transitions routed through cognitive
      load/self-regulation logic.

    - Dynamic fluency/sovereignty balancing, real-time recommendations.

- **Legal/Compliance Adaptors** (Priority: Must)

  - SoftCoercionFramework (Bundeskartellamt): Digital nudges,
    reversibility, and consent/choice audits for European and German
    law.

  - SectoralRegulationsFramework: Healthcare, finance, and GDPR
    overlays; per-sector compliance APIs.

- **CIA Framework (Complete 5-Stage)** (Priority: Must)

  - Scoping: Stakeholder/AI mapping, touchpoint workshops

  - Assessment: Audit logs, survey, and event capture

  - Mitigation: UI controls, mode toggles, reflection points

  - Monitoring: Telemetry and real-time/aggregate metric calculation

  - Reporting: Dashboarding, trend score aggregation, alerts

- **Mitigation Engines** (Priority: Must)

  - NotificationFatigueMitigation: Adaptive engagement and custom
    notification batching logic per user/task.

  - ProductivityImpactMitigation: Dashboard-driven reflection and
    workflow optimization.

- **Cross-Cultural Adaptation Layer** (Priority: Must)

  - CrossCulturalFramework (Hofstede, etc.): Prompts, phase transitions,
    overrides, and consent messaging localized per user/team context.

- **Audit Logging & Research Hooks** (Priority: Must)

  - Logging at every phase/action/transition (user, phase, agent, CSI,
    cultural/legal context, reason).

  - Integrated feedback/step-back hooks and rationales for research and
    regulatory review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users connect via authenticated API client; onboarding steps confirm
  region, culture, and compliance context.

- Documentation provided with sample workflows and phase configuration
  templates.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User or agent interfaces with endpoint for phase N (e.g.,
  initiate "Human Analysis").

  - System checks for preconditions and context (culture, sector, phase
    config).

  - Returns next steps, highlighting authorship/sovereignty, with audit
    ID for traceability.

- **Step 2:** During phase execution, transitions are dynamically routed
  via the FluencySovereignty and Legal engines.

  - Adaptive mode (manual/hybrid/auto) suggested; override logged.

  - All outputs checked for discursive integrity and informational
    dignity.

- **Step 3:** On completion or error, backend validates postconditions
  and either allows transition, blocks, or suggests step-back.

  - Users/agencies can invoke feedback/rewind with rationale—system
    rolls back state, updates audit.

- **Step 4:** At each phase, CSI/CIA/mitigation logic determines
  engagement, fatigue risk, and cross-cultural alignment.

- **Step 5:** System continuously exposes real-time compliance reports,
  engagement metrics, and status/trend dashboards for researchers and
  compliance officers.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Dynamic phase addition/removal and real-time config updates.

- Forced legal/compliance override or "manual review" on policy
  triggers.

- Multi-agent orchestration and conflict-resolution logic.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Every decision, prompt, and transition provides audit/tracing hooks.

- Accessibility, notification/minimal fatigue and culture-specific
  overlays.

## Narrative

Vanessa, an EU-based risk analyst at a multinational biotech firm,
tackles high-stakes investment scenarios using the Cognitive Mesh
platform. As she scopes a complex project, the system walks her through
a transparent, configurable phase workflow: Human Analysis, AI Pattern
Recognition, and Structured Human Validation. Each suggestion—no matter
how fluently generated—triggers audit trails, cultural adaptation of
prompts, and legal compliance checks for GDPR and sector-specific
regulations. If Vanessa ever feels rushed or overwhelmed, she can
initiate a step-back, see notification batch summaries, and review every
rationale in clear text. Behind the scenes, the NormativeAgency and
InformationEthics modules ensure true discursive integrity and epistemic
control. By project's end, Vanessa confidently presents an auditable
report—her reasoning, AI's contributions, cultural and legal framing—in
a format trusted by colleagues and external regulators. Her firm's
leadership recognizes not just the insight, but the rigorous,
human-centered process behind every critical decision.

  contracts.

- Every module (philosophy, culture, legal, CIA, sandwich, mitigation)
  versioned and loosely coupled.

- Centralized registry for dynamic phase/config management, contracts
  enforcement, and migration.

### Integration Points

- Azure cloud native, but RESTful contracts for extendibility.

- Integration-ready with upstream auth, org HR, regulatory reporting.

- Outbound hooks/APIs for frontend widgets and research dashboards.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Secure, resilient audit log; regional data residency compliance.

- All sensitive prompts, consent choices, and cognitive assessments
  encrypted in transit and at rest.

- No user data retained beyond necessary compliance or user
  directive—clear retention and deletion interfaces.

### Scalability & Performance

- Horizontal scalability by phase/adapter; adaptive caching for
  AI-intensive phases.

- System must handle global user base and multi-enterprise deployments.

- Batch and streaming telemetry support for real-time dashboards.

### Potential Challenges

- Harmonizing legal requirements across conflicting sector/region
  boundaries.

- Balancing exhaustive auditing versus user productivity and
  notification fatigue.

- Ensuring fail-safe prompt/decision handoff in multi-agent and team
  scenarios.
