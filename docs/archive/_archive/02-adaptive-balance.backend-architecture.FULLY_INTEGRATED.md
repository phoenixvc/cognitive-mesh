# Cognitive Mesh Adaptive Balance & Continuous Improvement Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Spectrum-Smart, Testable)

### TL;DR

Mesh widgets empower users, admins, and operators to actively visualize,
tune, and override critical behavioral and business spectrums—profit,
risk, agreeableness, identity, and learning—via intuitive sliders,
overlays, dashboards, and evidence uploads. Every adapter is
contract-bound, CI-tested, and engineered for rigorous NFR, rapid
evolution, and robust continuous improvement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve systematic, spectrum-based business decision quality at scale
  with measurable reduction in costly errors and missed opportunities

- Deliver auditable, compliance-ready continuous improvement to gain
  trust with enterprise customers and regulators

- Equip frontline, admin, and ops teams to nudge, monitor, and optimize
  key operating parameters in real time

- Minimize regression risk and onboarding effort through transparent,
  contract-driven widget design

### User Goals

- Empower users to visualize where each agent/system sits on critical
  spectrums (profitability, risk appetite, agreeableness, etc.) and
  nudge settings or override as needed

- Provide clear context and rationale for agent recommendations on every
  key decision

- Enable rapid upload and review of evidence that drives scenario
  learning and continuous agent optimization

- Simplify troubleshooting and compliance review with intuitive audit
  trails and event overlays

### Non-Goals

- This release does not cover backend-only enforcement engines or
  third-party integration widgets outside designated OpenAPI contracts

- Does not expose low-level algorithmic parameters without user-level
  abstraction or safeguards

- Excludes use in unregulated/high-risk financial or medical operations
  without further compliance review

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Business Admin**

- As a business admin, I want to instantly see where agents are taking
  too much or too little risk, so that I can nudge them back to a
  balanced position.

- As a business admin, I want to override agent pricing if it violates
  profit margins or agreed discount policy, so that the business always
  stays profitable.

- As a business admin, I want automated alerts if any widget falls out
  of compliance or migrates schema, so I can take action before any
  business impact.

**Operator/User**

- As an operator, I want to adjust the agent agreeableness slider so it
  neither over-promises nor frustrates customers.

- As an operator, I want clear feedback and a step-back overlay showing
  what the agent would have done differently with a different setting.

- As an operator, I want to upload new outcome evidence so future system
  recommendations get smarter.

**Compliance Lead**

- As a compliance lead, I want a complete audit log and evidence
  uploader to continuously prove and refine adherence to company and
  regulatory objectives.

- As a compliance lead, I want NIST/AI RMF checklist overlays embedded
  in the workflow so policy adherence is tracked from day one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Adaptive Balance Panel** (Priority: Critical)

  - Visualizes every key spectrum (profit, risk, agreeableness, identity
    grounding, learning rate) as accessible, contract-bound sliders

  - Surfaces system recommendations at both spectrum extremes with
    context/rationale

  - Allows override, with mandatory rationale, telemetry, and feedback
    capture

- **StepBack/Feedback Overlay** (Priority: Critical)

  - Shows counterfactuals (what would happen if the slider was further
    left/right)

  - Captures user rationales, prompts for additional evidence upload on
    override

- **Continuous Improvement Timeline** (Priority: High)

  - Displays learning events, evidence, nudges, and major trades/offers
    over time

  - Visualizes spectrum drift, rollback points, and stakeholder feedback
    events

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Monitor** (Priority: High)

  - Shows decomposition, model assignment, pending/failed tasks, and
    agent interaction

  - Provides spectrum and milestone feedback at each agent touchpoint

- **MilestoneConfigPanel** (Priority: High)

  - Allows policy authors/admins to define, adjust, and preview
    milestone workflows via config (see YAML example)

  - Supports rollback points and feedback/review triggers

- **NIST Checklist/Evidence Uploader** (Priority: High)

  - Embedded overlays for compliance, evidence mapping, and
    checklist-driven process

  - Allows in-context evidence submission, review checkpoints, and
    complete audit logging

- **Audit/Notification Overlay** (Priority: Critical)

  - Provides real-time banners for migration, contract drift, a11y
    regressions, or registry/policy overrides

  - Includes action links to migration docs and disables ineligible
    widgets after expiry

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users discover widgets via main agent dashboard or onboarding welcome
  overlay. Guidance bubbles introduce main spectrums and how to adjust
  sliders.

- First-time users receive a short onboarding animation explaining
  spectrum logic, overrides, and evidence upload.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Open Adaptive Balance Panel

  - Spectrum sliders for profit, risk, agreeableness, etc.

  - Real-time position, last nudge, and system recommendation displayed

  - Telemetry logs spectrum, suggestion, and user ID for every action

- **Step 2:** Adjust slider or select "Override"

  - Side overlay pops up showing both spectrum extremes and rationale

  - Must provide feedback or evidence if overriding system's setting

  - "Preview Impact" button runs a counterfactual on what the alternate
    setting would have meant

- **Step 3:** Immediate Impact/Feedback

  - UI confirms change, triggers event, and logs rationale

  - StepBack overlay available to explain logic, show chain of events,
    or propose alternate response

- **Step 4:** Continuous Improvement Timeline

  - Timeline clearly marks spectrum nudges, learning events, feedback,
    and rollback points

  - Evidence uploader allows batch submission or ad-hoc log of outcomes
    along the timeline

- **Step 5:** Compliance & Notification Overlays

  - If a widget or config is drifted, migration registry/email/Slack
    alert and overlay banner informs users and disables old widget after
    30d grace

  - All error or migration overlays include instant action links and
    status of peer widgets

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Automatic UI switch to "offline" if backend is degraded, allowing for
  local spectrum adjustment (syncs when online)

- A11y overlays on every slider/overlay: contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard
  access, locale

- "Override Fatigue" banner if user overrides system repeatedly—links to
  deeper analytics and counter-pattern rationale

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Consistent spectrum sliders with color-coded ranges, tooltips, and
  live context cut

- All feedback/step-back overlays readable at WCAG AA level and fully
  keyboard accessible

- Notification and registry overlays are non-blocking but require
  explicit dismissal or migration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

At a major enterprise, adaptive agents were rolled out to handle dynamic
customer offers, product pricing, and risk evaluation. Early on,
business leaders noticed recurrent failures in decision quality—profit
opportunity missed, over-discounting, and identity hallucinations
undermining trust. With the Cognitive Mesh Adaptive Balance widgets,
operators and admins finally gained clear, spectrum-based dashboards,
real-time nudges, and override control. StepBack overlays explain every
agent recommendation, and compliance leads now upload evidence and check
NIST adherence directly in workflow. Result: reduced costly errors,
improved commercial upside, and confident regulator-facing audit trails.
Now, business and technology teams iterate together—optimizing,
learning, and launching new agent scenarios with unprecedented agility
and control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- 

<!-- -->

- \<2% incident rate of operator overrides without feedback or evidence
  upload

- 

### Business Metrics

- +15% improvement in profit capture versus base scenario (tracked by
  timeline analysis)

- 0 critical audit/compliance failures and 100% continuous improvement
  evidence coverage

- Mean time to resolve spectrum drift/migration event \<24h

### Technical Metrics

- Widget cold start \<1s P99, P95 request latency \<200ms on all panels

- EvidenceUploader success rate \>99% on \<10MB files, upload \<1.5s

- All a11y/locale/user telemetry events pass validation with no registry
  blocks in CI

### Tracking Plan

- Log every spectrum slider adjust, override, evidence upload, migration
  overlay event, NIST checklist action, and A11y toggle

- Track average spectrum drift/fatigue and rollback frequency per
  user/session

- Daily error, migration, and notification event counts and response
  time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Widgets are pure mesh adapters via OpenAPI-bound DataAPIAdapterPort
  (e.g. /docs/spec/balance.yaml#/paths/1v11balance~1get)

- StepBack, Notification, and MilestoneConfig panels universally
  available in all UI shells

- Shared telemetry and error schema

- Registry hooks block or disable panels on drift or migration events

### Integration Points

- Direct backend contract via OpenAPI, registry migration hooks,
  compliance/audit logging endpoint

- All audit and evidence events loggable to centralized evidence data
  store

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No permanent user PII stored on widget layer; only event/telemetry
  logs with correlationID

- All evidence subject to role/permission checks and user confirmation

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 10k+ concurrent widget sessions; bundle size
  \<400kB/panel; memory \<30MB/panel

- EvidenceAvatar token buckets for uploader throttling

- All panels support "offline-first" UI fallback and auto-recover on
  reconnect

### Potential Challenges

- Balancing intuitive UI control with flexibility for expert users
  (avoiding "options fatigue")

- Maintaining a11y parity and locale coverage as panels/overlays evolve

- Ensuring all telemetry/events are reliably captured and
  registry-enforced

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scaffolding Configuration DSL Example (YAML)

milestones:

- name: 'Human Analysis' pre: \[user-logged-in, requirements-collected\]
  post: \[problem-defined, confirmation-received\] feedback_enabled:
  true rollback_to: null

- name: 'AI Processing' pre: \[problem-defined\] post:
  \[draft-generated\] feedback_enabled: true rollback_to: 'Human
  Analysis'

This format supports rapid team-specific extension using
MilestoneConfigPanelAdapter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Error Envelope Schema (Appendix)

{ error_code, message, correlationID }

All adapters reference this schema for overlays, telemetry, and
snapshot/CI test cases, with OpenAPI and registry cross-reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deprecation & Notification Workflow

- Contract drift, migration, or new version disables widget with
  registry/email/Slack alert

- Overlay banner prompts users/admins, with direct migration
  documentation links

- Registry disables widget globally after 30 days if not upgraded or
  migrated
