# Convener Backend Architecture PRD

### TL;DR

The Convener backend is a secure, API-driven platform that supports
champion discovery, community monitoring, innovation tracking, and
psychological safety. It serves as the orchestration layer for all
Convener widgets and dashboard integrations, enabling organizations to
measure and enhance collective intelligence and innovation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals Overview

- Accelerate collaboration and innovation workflows that lead to
  measurable organizational outcomes.

- Enable objective measurement of collective intelligence and the
  factors that drive successful team interactions.

- Protect and enhance community trust by ensuring psychological safety
  and transparent data practices.

- Provide reliable, extensible APIs to support all Convener widgets and
  mesh integrations

### User Goals Overview

- Provide users with real-time, accurate recommendations for potential
  champions and collaborators based on current engagement data.

- Deliver actionable insights on community health and learning
  opportunities, enabling users to make informed decisions and
  interventions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements Overview

### Champion Discovery Service (Priority: Must Have)

- Identify and score champions and connectors using interaction data,
  endorsements, and event signals.

- Given real-time data, when a discovery request is initiated, then the
  service returns a ranked list of champions with audit trails.

- Acceptance Criteria: Results reflect current state accurately;
  provenance recorded for every recommendation.

### Community Pulse Service (Priority: Must)

- Aggregate engagement, sentiment, and psychological safety metrics at
  team, org, cohort levels.

- Given team activity streams, when a pulse check is initiated, then the
  service provides up-to-date risk, engagement, and support metrics.

- Acceptance Criteria: Metrics refresh in under 5 minutes; data scoped
  to org/tenant.

### Learning Catalyst Orchestration (Priority: Should)

- Curate, tag, and push learning and experimentation logs, linking
  contributions to outcomes.

- Given new learning events, when logged, then the system associates
  outcomes to originating contributors.

- Acceptance Criteria: 90%+ of catalyst actions are correctly
  attributed.

### Innovation Spread Engine (Priority: Should)

- Detect, log, and propagate innovations or successful patterns across
  the mesh (virality tracking).

- Given a flagged innovation, when replication is observed, then the
  system records lineage and adoption metrics.

- Acceptance Criteria: All adoptions are checked for both source and
  destination tenant boundaries.

### Approval/Consent Service (Priority: Must)

- Manage explicit user and admin approvals for sharing, recommendations,
  and escalations.

- Given a recommendation with potential privacy impact, when user
  approval is required, then service sends approvals and logs response.

- Acceptance Criteria: No personal data is recommended/shared without
  explicit consent.

### Provenance Event Logging (Priority: Must)

- Create, persist, and surface provenance logs for all system-initiated
  actions and recommendations.

- Given an event or recommendation, when it is processed, then a
  detailed provenance event is logged.

- Acceptance Criteria: 100% of API actions traceable; all provenance
  logs time-stamped and tenant-scoped.

### Notification/Push Service (Priority: Should)

- Distribute real-time signals, recommendations, and feedback requests
  to relevant widgets and users.

- Given a trigger in any service, when notification criteria are met,
  then push updates are dispatched with full audit trail.

- Acceptance Criteria: 95%+ notification delivery in \<500ms on active
  mesh sessions.

- All features designed for deep ecosystem extensibility (custom
  signals, plugin partnerships, org-specific extensions).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## API and Data Contract Overview

### API Contract Reference

- API Spec: (Pending) All endpoints and schemas will be defined and
  versioned in the shared OpenAPI document, referenced by both backend
  and frontend/widget PRDs.

- Change Management: All schema changes must be reviewed in both PRDs
  and approved by product/engineering leads.

### Core Endpoints

  - Inputs: org context, search filters

  - Outputs: ranked list, scores, provenance

- /pulse/aggregate

  - Inputs: team/org ID, metric type

  - Outputs: pulse data, risk flags, timestamps

- /learning/catalysts

  - Inputs: event logs

  - Outputs: curated catalyst events, contributor mapping

- /innovation/spread

  - Inputs: innovation ID

  - Outputs: replication lineage, adoption metrics

- /approvals/request

  - Inputs: event, user ID, scope

  - Outputs: approval status, reason, log

- /provenance/events

- API versioning via /v1/, /v2/ pathing, n–1 compatibility.

- All events/actions include provenance and audit fields.

- All data contract changes logged and announced per NFR policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Orchestration, Processing Flows & Visuals

### Sequence Diagrams (examples)

- **Champion Matchmaking**:

  1.  Widget triggers /champions/discover

  2.  Service gathers signals, matches criteria

  3.  Orchestrator applies ranking/scoring

  4.  Provenance log created

  5.  API responds to widget, widget renders

- **Pulse Aggregation**:

  1.  Widget requests /pulse/aggregate

  2.  API orchestrates aggregate queries

  3.  Results scored for risk/support

  4.  Provenance and context logged

  5.  Widget displays pulse, trends, risks

- **Cross-Doc Flow Diagram**:  
  User clicks widget → Widget API call → Backend orchestrator →
  Provenance logging → Widget UI update → User approval/feedback.

*Visuals included in shared architecture diagrams and onboarding
documentation.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Storage, Privacy, and Security Overview

- **Storage Models**:

  - Structured, tenant-isolated relational DBs for user/team/org event
    data

  - Partitioned event logs, strict foreign key constraints for
    provenance

- **Privacy & Consent**:

  - All sensitive data encrypted (AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit)

  - Explicit consent mapping to all personal data flows

- **Security**:

  - Token-based endpoint access, per-tenant rate limiting

  - All access and mutation events audit-logged

  - Inheritance of Global NFR on privacy, encryption, audit, compliance

- **Data Governance**:

  - Data residency and jurisdictional controls per tenant/region

  - Centralized secrets/config management

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Error, Offline, Resilience

- Offline Behavior

  - Cached last-known champion/pulse/catalyst data surfaced in absence
    of fresh API

  - Widgets display error banner with timestamp and cause on service/API
    failure

  - Partial service degradation falls back to minimal safe default
    (e.g., no recommendation, static content)

- Resilience and Recovery

  - Database backups hourly (hot), daily (cold); cross-region failover
    supported

  - RPO: 1 hour; RTO: 2 hours for all stateful services

  - Incident response: Severity 1 = 5 min ack/30 min mitigation;
    Severity 2–3 as per NFR

- **Disaster Recovery**:

  - Periodic DR drills; auto-failover battle-tested quarterly

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Observability & Non-Functionals

- **Tracing & Metrics**:

  - OpenTelemetry-enabled distributed tracing for all API flows

  - Metrics: latency, error rates, per-API/tenant quotas

  - Real-time dashboards (Grafana integration) and alert thresholds

- **Availability**:

  - 99.9% uptime target for all public services; sandbox/non-prod
    isolation for plugin testing

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**:

  - Per-tenant and global API quotas with exponential backoff and safe
    retries

- **Global NFR Inheritance**:

  - All security, compliance, audit, DR, incident response requirements
    inherited by reference and covered in NFR appendix
