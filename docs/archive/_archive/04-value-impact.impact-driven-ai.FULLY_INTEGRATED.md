# Cognitive Mesh NIST AI RMF Maturity Framework Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Testable)

### TL;DR

Mesh widgets empower users, admins, and auditors to directly manage,
evidence, and track the NIST AI RMF maturity process. The UI suite
covers end-to-end assessment checklists, artifact/evidence handling,
scoring dashboards, improvement tracking, and compliance alerting—built
for regulatory assurance, continuous improvement, and stakeholder
transparency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve and maintain a minimum maturity score of 3.5/5 across all NIST
  RMF statements in year 1.

- Streamline regulatory compliance processes for enterprise clients,
  reducing audit preparation time by 50%.

- Deliver provable, evidence-based AI governance that differentiates the
  Cognitive Mesh offering.

- Increase customer trust and contract wins by demonstrating real-time
  auditability.

- Achieve user adoption by all key persona groups within 90 days
  post-launch.

### User Goals

- Enable users to easily complete and submit NIST assessments and
  supporting evidence with minimal training.

- Allow admins to review, approve, and comment on submitted artifacts in
  a centralized dashboard.

- Provide instant visibility into compliance status, maturity scores,
  and roadmap gaps.

- Keep all stakeholders informed of required upgrades, drift, or
  deprecation through UI notifications.

- Ensure users can locate and understand requirements, evidence, and
  improvement plans at a glance.

### Non-Goals

- The UI will not serve as a primary interface for managing user
  authentication or access policies.

- Will not automate legal or regulatory filings outside the provided
  evidence export features.

- Will not support custom maturity models outside of the NIST AI RMF
  scope (V1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Compliance Officer**

- As a Compliance Officer, I want to walk through the NIST checklist, so
  that I can identify maturity gaps across the organization.

- As a Compliance Officer, I want to review uploaded evidence, so that I
  ensure regulatory standards are met.

- As a Compliance Officer, I want to receive notifications of upcoming
  deprecation or drift, so that I can proactively plan for migrations.

**Persona: AI Product Owner**

- As an AI Product Owner, I want to see a real-time maturity dashboard,
  so I can communicate status and next steps to leadership.

- As an AI Product Owner, I want to submit supporting documentation for
  each NIST requirement, so that progress tracking is centralized.

**Persona: Internal Auditor**

- As an Internal Auditor, I want to view, filter, and export complete
  audit trails (who submitted what, when), so I can confidently pass
  compliance reviews.

**Persona: Business Executive**

- As a Business Executive, I want executive summaries and improvement
  roadmaps presented concisely, so I can make informed resource
  investment decisions.

**Persona: External Stakeholder**

- As an External Reviewer, I want to see clear, immutable evidence and
  maturity scores, so I can verify the organization's AI maturity
  claims.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Assessment Panels** (Priority: Must)

  - NIST RMF Checklist Panel: Walks users through each NIST
    pillar/topic; one-click progression and "mark complete."

  - Evidence Upload Panel: Allows direct markdown/file artifact uploads,
    reviewer assignment, and artifact audit linking.

  - Scoring Dashboard: Real-time maturity scoring and RMF pillar
    sub-scores.

  - Improvement Roadmap Panel: Prioritized, actionable plan aligned to
    maturity assessment gaps.

  - Notification Panel: Registry/contract drift, error, migration, and
    review requests.

  - Audit & Activity Log: Time-stamped, filterable, and exportable logs
    of every artifact, review, and state change.

- **Adapters** (Priority: Must)

  - DataAPIAdapterPort (per topic/statement) with OpenAPI JSON pointer
    mapping.

  - EvidenceUploadAdapter: Handles markdown/files, artifact size/format
    validation.

  - DashboardAdapter: Fetches, visualizes, and exports scoring/status.

  - NotificationAdapter: Real-time alerts, overlays, in-app and registry
    integration.

  - TelemetryAdapter: Logs all user actions, errors, a11y events, state
    transitions.

- **G/W/T Acceptance Criteria** (Priority: Must)

  - For every action/endpoint, acceptance is defined for normal, error,
    migration, a11y, registry drift, and off-line states.

- **Shared Error/Envelope Handling** (Priority: Must)

  - All error events and overlays reference the shared { error_code,
    message, correlationID } schema.

- **Registry/Migration Handling** (Priority: Must)

  - Overlays and guides for deprecation, contract drift, version
    upgrades; explicit registry acknowledgement required for breaking
    changes.

- **Executive & Compliance Dashboards** (Priority: Should)

  - One-click executive summary, export of audit/compliance report, and
    improvement plan snapshot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users land on a guided NIST assessment dashboard via SSO or workspace
  invite.

- First-time onboarding includes a brief interactive tutorial,
  highlights navigation, and checklist usage.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User selects a NIST topic or statement from the left-side
  checklist navigation.

  - Immediate feedback: Progress bar, statement status, and "artifact
    required" flag are visible.

  - If the panel is incomplete, prompt to upload artifact or add
    explanation.

- **Step 2:** Artifact/Evidence panel is accessible.

  - Markdown/file uploader (e.g., drag-and-drop), field for reviewer
    assignment, strict validation on file size/format.

  - G/W/T overlays for error (e.g., oversize, invalid), migration,
    deprecation, or incomplete submission.

- **Step 3:** Reviewer receives notification in the Notification panel
  and via registry/email if assigned.

  - Reviewer views artifact, leaves comment/approves, initiates feedback
    loop.

- **Step 4:** Dashboard auto-updates with scoring based on evidence and
  status; improvement roadmap panel updates with next steps and gaps.

- **Step 5:** All user actions, artifact uploads, review decisions,
  notifications, and migrations are logged in the Audit panel,
  filterable and exportable.

- **Step 6:** If registry notices drift or deprecation, overlay modal
  blocks progress until migration acknowledged or upgrade guide
  completed.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power-user shortcut toggles for mass artifact upload, evidence bulk
  review, or rapid tab-bar navigation.

- All panels and overlays support colorblind/a11y, platform
  responsiveness, and offline/failure fallback.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Immediate visual feedback for state (complete/incomplete, reviewed,
  drift/deprecated).

- Consistent overlay behaviors for error, notification, deprecation,
  feedback, and registry events.

- Pattern library used for all critical overlays, states, notifications,
  and audit snapshots.

- All interactive components keyboard accessible, a11y-optimized,
  responsive on all target devices.

- Direct links out to current OpenAPI spec/documentation for every
  evidence or scoring action.

## Narrative

A compliance officer logs in to the Cognitive Mesh maturity dashboard.
With a few clicks, they're guided through each NIST RMF
statement—understanding exactly what's required, what evidence must be
gathered, and who needs to participate in review. They upload audit
artifacts, assign reviewers, and immediately see scoring progress and
improvement gaps. Whenever a requirement, API, or contract changes, the
officer is proactively notified: overlays guide the upgrade, while every
submission, comment, and migration is tracked in a centralized,
filterable audit log. Executives can instantly view compliance status
and actionable plans—knowing with certainty that their governance
posture is robust and always NIST-aligned. This experience gives
enterprise teams the speed, clarity, and confidence to demonstrate—at
any moment—that their AI systems are governed and maturing with
discipline.

- System: API error, drift/deprecation, registry notice, a11y incident

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Core APIs: Checklist/state (GET/PUT), Evidence (POST/GET), Reviewer
  Actions (POST), Scoring Summary (GET), Notifications (GET/ACK),
  Telemetry (POST), AuditLog (GET)

- All adapters and panels point to exact OpenAPI JSON Pointers (e.g.,
  /docs/spec/nist.yaml#/paths/1governance1nist1evidence1submit)

- Shared Error Envelope schema in all endpoint and event models

- Registry hooks for migration/deprecation, evidence versioning

- Live telemetry/feedback pipelines for all actions and errors

### Integration Points

- SSO, org registry, audit/export tools, back-office evidence API

- Slack/email for stakeholder review/notification

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Artifacts stored encrypted, versioned, and audit-linked beyond
  retention window

- Access/review only to permitted and assigned users

- All actions/data changes audit-logged with timestamp and correlationID

- GDPR and sector-aligned data handling (evidence/file expiration
  policies)

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 1–5k simultaneous users/org (burst for audit reviews)

- Dynamic cache for audit dash, O(1) scoring, lazy-load artifact
  previews

### Potential Challenges

- Handling schema drift during contract migrations

- Review bottlenecks in large evidence runs

- UI bundle within strict NFR (size/memory/latency)

- Ensuring all states and overlays are a11y-compliant and testable
