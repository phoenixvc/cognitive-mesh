# Global Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Appendix - Cognitive Mesh

## Purpose and Scope of the Global NFR Appendix

The Global Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Appendix establishes
mandatory standards that apply to all components of the Cognitive Mesh.
These standards cover security, telemetry, versioning, audit logging,
privacy, quality, and compliance.

Every Product Requirement Document (PRD) for platform, backend, or
widget/feature components must explicitly reference and comply with
these NFRs.

Extensions or exceptions to these requirements are allowed only if they
are clearly documented and justified within the respective PRD.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Security

- **Data in Transit:**  
  All data exchanged between clients, services, and third parties must
  be encrypted via TLS 1.2 or higher.

- **Data at Rest:**  
  Persisted data must be encrypted using AES-256 or an organizationally
  approved standard. Encryption keys must be securely managed and
  access-limited.

- **Access Control & Multitenancy:**  
  Every service, plugin, and user interaction must enforce
  least-privilege access and strict tenant data isolation. No
  cross-tenant data access without explicit, auditable consent.

- **Secure Development Lifecycle:**  
  All releases (core, plugins, or widgets) require mandatory peer code
  reviews and static/dynamic security scans before deployment.

- **Penetration Testing & Remediation:**  
  Conduct penetration tests on all major releases at least quarterly.
  High-severity findings must be documented and remediated on a defined
  timeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Telemetry & Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging:**  
  Log all API invocations, privilege escalations, data access events,
  and critical system or plugin actions. Each log entry captures actor
  identity, timestamp, action, and relevant request context.

- **Log Retention & Integrity:**  
  Retain logs for the duration dictated by applicable compliance policy
  (minimum 1 year unless otherwise required).  
  Employ tamper-evidence mechanisms and maintain a chain-of-custody for
  sensitive logs.

- **Plugin/User-Facing Telemetry:**  
  All plugins/widgets must publish their use of telemetry. End-users
  must be informed of what analytics is collected, and opt-out is
  required for any non-essential data collection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Versioning & Compatibility

- **Semantic Versioning:**  
  All APIs (core and plugin), plugin manifests, and dashboard schemas
  must adhere to semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

- **Compatibility Window:**  
  Backwards compatibility is required for "n–1" major platform versions.
  Incompatible changes require a clear migration strategy and transition
  path.

- **Deprecation Policy:**  
  PRDs introducing breaking changes must provide a 90-day advance public
  deprecation notice, outlining upgrade procedures.

- **Incompatibility Handling:**  
  If a widget or plugin is incompatible with the loaded platform
  version, users must see a clear, actionable warning and safe fallback
  defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Privacy & Data Governance

- **Data Regulation Adherence:**  
  All personal and user data is processed and stored in accordance with
  GDPR and CCPA, or any jurisdiction with stricter data privacy
  standards. This applies globally, not just in regulated regions.

- **Consent for Data Sharing:**  
  Explicit, informed user consent is required before any data is shared
  across tenants or with third parties, including for plugins sourced
  from outside the core organization.

- **Data Sovereignty Enforcement:**  
  All user and tenant data is logically and physically separated.
  Unauthorized cross-tenant access—by plugins, services, or users—is
  prohibited and technically enforced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Compliance

- **Industry Compliance Readiness:**  
  The Cognitive Mesh and all subcomponents are auditable for:

  - SOC2 Type II

  - GDPR (and others, as required by organizational mandate)

- **Audit Trails:**  
  All data handling operations and user consent interactions are fully
  logged. These records are accessible for audit by compliance teams in
  accordance with policy and regulation.

- **Policy Updates and Training:**  
  All staff involved in developing, deploying, or operating Cognitive
  Mesh components must be trained annually on latest compliance,
  security, and privacy requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Quality Gates & SLAs

- **Availability:**  
  All critical APIs and the platform shell must reach a minimum 99.9%
  availability, measured monthly.  
  Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) must
  be documented for all major services.

- **Performance:**

  - Initial dashboard/widget load time with three default plugins: \<1
    second (target); must not exceed 2 seconds.

  - Maximum allowed resource utilization per widget and per session, to
    be specified in implementation PRDs.

- **Error Handling:**  
  All user-facing errors must be accompanied by actionable feedback and
  logged internally for rapid triage.  
  Graceful degradation and offline fallback modes are required for all
  non-core functionality.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Every user-facing element (core dashboard, widgets, plugin UIs) must
  comply with WCAG 2.1 AA.  
  All user-facing text and dialogs must be fully internationalizable
  with locale-fallbacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Observability & Tracing

- All platform and plugin components must emit distributed trace data
  (e.g., OpenTelemetry). Required: correlation IDs spanning user flows,
  model calls, and plugin interactions.

- User-facing and operational metrics (latency, error rates, throughput)
  must be exposed via a dashboarding tool (e.g., Grafana) and made
  queryable for rapid troubleshooting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Set documented global and per-tenant API rate limits for core
  orchestration, telemetry, and marketplace endpoints.

- All components must implement intelligent back-off/retry behavior and
  log rate-limit hits for operational review. Noisy plugins must never
  degrade global stability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Backup, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

- Define backup frequency for all stateful services; specify and test
  RPO (recovery point objective) and RTO (recovery time objective).

- Document failover processes (pilot light, warm standby) and require
  regular DR/failover drills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Configuration Management & Secrets Handling

- All secrets and credentials must be stored in a centralized secrets
  manager (e.g., Azure Key Vault); hardcoding in code or config is
  explicitly prohibited.

- Use immutable infrastructure and drift detection to manage config
  changes and maintain environment integrity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Incident Response & Change Management

- Maintain severity-based incident classifications, with documented
  response time targets for each severity level.

- Require post-mortem analyses for major incidents and a formal
  change-approval board for all breaking platform/API/plugin changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Data Residency & Jurisdictional Controls

- Respect customer- or tenant-specified data residency (e.g., EU-only,
  US-only); implement data geofencing/enforcement and validate during
  SOC2/GDPR audits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Chaos Engineering & SLA Validation

- Require scheduled fault-injection ('chaos monkey') exercises to
  validate system resilience.

- Run quarterly SLA audits to demonstrate \<99.9%\> platform
  availability and failover effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 14. Developer Sandbox & Isolation

- Provide a realistic, production-isolated developer sandbox to test
  plugins and UIs. No unvetted code or plugin can access live production
  tenant data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Reference in PRDs

Include the following standard statement in every Cognitive Mesh
platform, backend, or plugin/widget PRD:

- When extending or amending:

  - Explicitly state the change and define how it overrides, enhances,
    or relaxes the appendix NFR.

  - Justify the modification in terms of business, technical, legal, or
    user need.

  - Document an audit path for any non-standard exceptions.

*The Global NFR Appendix is a living standard, periodically reviewed and
upgraded in alignment with organizational, regulatory, and industry
requirements. All product teams are responsible for ensuring their
features remain compliant with this baseline.*
