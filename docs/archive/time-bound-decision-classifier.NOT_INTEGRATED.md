# Time-Bound & Data-Based Decision Classifier PRD

### TL;DR

A mesh-integrated service that analyzes the context and characteristics
of each decision—such as deadline, data complexity, and subjectivity—and
automatically classifies tasks as AI-ESSENTIAL, HUMAN-FIRST, or
BALANCED. It then routes each decision accordingly, reducing errors and
maximizing workflow efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve a 30% reduction in overall decision routing errors.

- Consistently route tasks to the most effective human/AI blend.

- Enhance auditability and compliance in all critical workflows.

### User Goals

- Give users instant feedback on when to trust automation versus
  personal judgment.

- Increase confidence by ensuring every decision is appropriately
  classified and routed.

- Provide visibility and traceability for every decision outcome.

### Non-Goals

- The service will not automate the content of decisions—only the
  routing.

- It will not override regulatory or explicitly human-only mandates.

- It will not provide real-time coaching; focus is exclusively on
  routing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Process Owners: ensure proper decision routing and audit compliance.

- End Users: receive clear guidance on decision routing and trust levels.

- Compliance Officers: review audit trails and ensure regulatory compliance.

- Business Analysts: measure routing accuracy and efficiency improvements.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- **Process Owner:**

  - As a process owner, I want assurance every decision is routed to the
    right mix, so that no critical step is handled by AI or humans alone
    by accident.

  - As a process owner, I want an auditable log of all routing decisions
    for every high-impact task.

- **End User:**

  - As an end user, I want instant clarity on whether to rely on system
    automation or my own judgment, so I never misapply trust in the
    system.

  - As an end user, I want notification and context if a decision
    routing mode changes due to new data or deadline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - POST /decision/mode: Accepts extracted features, returns one of
    {AI_ESSENTIAL, HUMAN_FIRST, BALANCED}. Response time ≤150ms.

- **Execution Routing** (Priority: Must)

  - POST /decision/execute: Accepts mode and all payload metadata;
    executes via augmentation services or routes to a human queue with
    full traceability.

- **Centralized Logging & Audit** (Priority: Must)

  - Every step, mode, and routing choice is logged with correlationID,
    full input context, and classifier version in real time.

- **Mesh-Standard Error Envelope** (Priority: Must)

  - All responses use standard envelope containing error_code, message,
    correlationID, and data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all decision classification and routing endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all decision routing events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Classification response time <100ms, mode selection ≤150ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the classifier through their decision dashboard or are
  prompted within the mesh workflow at any moment of decision.

- Onboarding includes a simple walk-through/modal that explains how
  routing decisions occur and how to interpret mode status.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User submits or is assigned a decision task via dashboard
  or API.

  - UI provides clear input fields for scenario, deadline, data type,
    and subjectivity markers.

  - Backend validates the payload and logs a new correlationID.

- **Step 2:** The system invokes /decision/classify, which returns the
  complete extracted feature set for visibility and trace.

  - Users may view a summary of the computed features and context churn.

- **Step 3:** The system calls /decision/mode, instantly returning the
  recommended collaboration mode.

  - The UI highlights mode with explanation ("AI-ESSENTIAL due to tight
    deadline and high data volume," etc.).

- **Step 4:** Upon confirmation (auto or user), task is executed through
  /decision/execute.

  - Human tasks are placed in the correct queues, AI-ESSENTIAL routed to
    augmentation engines.

  - Result and all logs are returned/displayed, with a permanent audit
    trail accessible.

- **Step 5:** If an error or boundary failure occurs at any stage, a
  clear message is returned following the mesh-standard error envelope.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Exception alerts and role-based overrides for high-risk,
  high-subjectivity, or nonstandard decisions.

- Power-users can download full audit logs or see classifier confidence
  scores.

- Re-runs available if scenario context changes (e.g., new deadline,
  updated data).

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Decision mode status is prominent and color-coded.

- Detailed tooltips explain classification choices and rationales.

- Accessibility: Full screen-reader support; keyboard navigation; high
  contrast modes.

### Integration Points

- Mesh dashboard and augmentation services for real-time
  execution/routing.

- Audit stores via Cosmos DB/SQL.

- Role-based authentication with RBAC.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Only logs inputs, context, and routing results—never full user
  content.

- All audit logs are timestamped, immutable, and linked to
  correlationIDs.

- Fully compliant with privacy mandates; context can be anonymized on
  demand.

### Scalability & Performance

- Auto-scale API pods when requests exceed 70% CPU or 150 requests/sec.

- Connection pooling and retry for all DB/logging writes.

### Potential Challenges

- Accurate subjectivity/judgment extraction may require iterative
  tuning.

- High-frequency edge decisions could require immediate human review to
  avoid risk.

- Data privacy and regulatory auditability must be maintained at every
  touchpoint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
