# Cognitive Mesh Context Engineering Backend PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Multi-Framework)

### TL;DR

This backend transforms Cognitive Mesh by treating context as a
systematically engineered discipline, not an afterthought. It delivers
dynamic orchestration, multi-tier memory management (working,
short-term, long-term, episodic), context degradation syndrome (CDS)
prevention, and framework-specific context mapping for each cognitive
capability. All features are explicitly mapped, contract-bound,
testable, and version-controlled to enable resilient, production-grade
cognitive augmentation for teams and organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve measurable reduction in AI decision errors attributed to
  context loss or drift.

- Enable multi-framework, domain-specific AI workflows through
  composable, reusable context APIs.

- Ensure production-grade reliability and auditability of cognitive
  decisions and knowledge flow.

- Decrease time to deploy business-specific frameworks by integrating
  context engineering as a first-class layer.

- Differentiate Cognitive Mesh as the most context-resilient, adaptive,
  and auditable AI architecture on the market.

### User Goals

- Users' decisions, outputs, and recommendations reflect all available,
  relevant contextnever just the last prompt.

- Stakeholders experience fewer context-driven errors and receive
  proactive alerts on drift/fading/vagueness.

- Specialized agents and frameworks function with rich,
  framework-specific context without manual configuration.

- Stakeholders and admins can audit, tune, and intervene in memory/state
  for compliance, transparency, or troubleshooting.

- Context is meaningfully surfaced and visualized to all relevant UX
  layers and system actors.

### Non-Goals

- Do not cover UI/UX or frontend display logic (deferred to widget PRD).

- Do not support legacy, one-shot prompt-based workflows.

- Do not duplicate business logic from upstream frameworks; focus only
  on context/data, not domain rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Prompt/App Developers: primary users for context APIs.

- Cognitive Mesh Operators: manage memory and context policies.

- Business Stakeholders: review context health and audit logs.

- End Users: benefit from context-rich AI experiences.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Personas**

- Cognitive Mesh Operator (Admin)

- AI Agent Developer

- Business Stakeholder

- End User (Knowledge Worker)

**Stories**

- As a Cognitive Mesh Operator, I want to define memory and context
  policies, so that agents automatically select the right level of
  context for every workflow.

- As an AI Agent Developer, I want a contract-driven API to retrieve,
  update, or purge any type of memory (working, session, long,
  episodic), so that my agent's reasoning never loses key data.

- As a Business Stakeholder, I want to receive proactive alerts if
  context degrades (drift, vagueness, contradiction), so that decisions
  remain reliable and compliant.

- As an End User, I want my AI solutions to remember my preferences,
  history, and unique knowledge across sessions, so that my experience
  feels consistent, personal, and valuable.

- As a Mesh Operator, I want clear audit logs and rollback options for
  every context change, so that I can trace, validate, or correct any
  decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Context Orchestration & Management (Priority: Critical)**

  - Dynamic orchestration of all context flows across agents and
    frameworks.

  - Adaptive management of context memory tiers: working, short-term,
    long-term, episodic.

  - Contract-based context CRUD, TTL, promotion, audit, and policy/tag
    management.

  - Notification and alerting on context drift, vagueness, or
    contradiction (CDS) per policy.

- **Framework-Specific Context Mapping (Priority: Critical)**

  - Explicit context contracts for each framework (impact, safety,
    passion, identity, etc.).

  - FrameworkContextMapper orchestrates context requirements and output
    delivery.

  - Prioritized, adaptive context weighting and orchestration for
    multi-framework intersection scenarios.

- **CDS Prevention & Drift Management (Priority: High)**

  - Real-time detection of context degradation patterns (drift,
    forgetting, contradiction, vagueness).

  - Automated CDS intervention: alerts, rollback, and remediation paths.

  - Configurable thresholds and policies for degradation management.

- **Audit & Summarization (Priority: High)**

  - Full audit trail for all context and memory changes, accessible by
    API.

  - Session and memory summarization for review or export.

  - Promotion paths for significant context events (e.g., session 
    long-term, episodic).

- **Governance, Resilience & Migration (Priority: High)**

  - Migration/upgrade endpoint: registry, notification (email/Slack),
    overlay flows.

  - Shared error envelope for all APIs.

  - Full versioning and resilience: auto-disable/all-clear on missed
    migrations.

- **Integration & Monitoring (Priority: Essential)**

  - Integration-ready, OpenAPI 3.1 with strict JSON pointer mapping.

  - Central registry of all context APIs and adapters.

  - Ready-to-integrate APIs for observability, failure, and improvement
    measurement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- 99.9% uptime for all context APIs and endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all context and memory events.
