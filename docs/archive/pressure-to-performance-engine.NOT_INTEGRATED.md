# Pressure-to-Performance Transformation Engine PRD

### TL;DR

Detects user cognitive overload in real-time tasks—such as lags, errors,
or stress—and instantly adapts the level of AI assistance (FULL,
SELECTIVE, MINIMAL), restoring optimal performance. The engine operates
as a mesh sidecar service and automatically scales with demand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Decrease user error rates by 60% during high-pressure situations.

- Ensure continuous productivity and resilience in live,
  mission-critical environments.

- Provide demonstrable ROI by mitigating cognitive overload bottlenecks.

### User Goals

- Experience seamless AI assistance exactly when pressure ramps up,
  without manual intervention.

- Never drop below essential AI support, even in critical overload.

- Receive transparent notifications when AI help intensifies or relaxes,
  with clear rationale.

### Non-Goals

- Not intended to directly address long-term skill or learning
  development.

- Will not intervene in non-real-time or asynchronous workflows.

- Does not attempt to override human judgment or manually set AI help
  levels (except via admin override).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Knowledge Workers: experience AI assistance during high-pressure situations.

- Operations Leads: monitor system reliability and compliance.

- Admins: configure pressure thresholds and AI assistance policies.

- Performance Analysts: measure cognitive overload reduction and error prevention.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Knowledge Worker**

- As a knowledge worker, I want AI to automatically detect when I'm
  overwhelmed, so that I get extra support before errors or delays
  occur.

- As a knowledge worker, I want the system to always provide at least a
  minimum level of AI help, so that I'm never left without support in
  high-pressure tasks.

**Operations Lead**

- As an operations lead, I want to validate that AI always provides a
  backstop of help during peak moments, so that system reliability can
  be demonstrated to stakeholders.

- As an operations lead, I want a full audit trail of all help mode
  switches, so that compliance and accountability are ensured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Overload Detection** (Priority: Must)

  - POST /pressure/detect: Accepts real-time telemetry and returns
    pressure/overload level within 100 ms.

  - Shared error envelope (error_code, message, correlationID, data).

- **Mode Selector** (Priority: Must)

  - POST /pressure/mode: Accepts current overload level; returns AI
    support mode (FULL, SELECTIVE, MINIMAL) within 100 ms.

  - All responses use shared error envelope.

- **Dynamic AI Ramp-Up** (Priority: Must)

  - WebSocket /pressure/ramp: Allows clients to subscribe for mode
    changes and receive new AI configuration in real time as soon as
    overload is detected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all pressure detection and AI assistance endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all mode changes and overload events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Overload detection response time <100ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access core productivity or workflow apps, which are
  mesh-enabled out of the box.

- No explicit onboarding required; users are notified that AI will
  assist them automatically during high-pressure intervals.

- Admin users have access to a configuration pane to set policy
  thresholds, exceptions, and notification preferences.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** The user operates in a high-pressure environment (e.g.,
  live support, trading floor, urgent incident response).

  - The system continuously monitors for cognitive overload using
    latency, error, and interaction signals.

  - All monitoring is frictionless, runs in the background, and is
    invisible unless triggered.

- **Step 2:** Overload is detected.

  - Within 100 ms, POST /pressure/detect is triggered from the client or
    a mesh agent.

  - If overload exceeds set thresholds, a new support mode is chosen by
    POST /pressure/mode.

  - The Dynamic AI Ramp-Up service emits a new configuration via
    WebSocket to subscribed clients.

- **Step 3:** The user receives elevated AI support.

  - Subtle status badge or color indicator shows current AI help level.

  - Non-intrusive notification appears only when support mode changes
    (e.g., "AI support increased for your session").

- **Step 4:** All mode changes are logged.

  - Full details are available for admin and compliance review.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Users never have their AI support drop below the defined MINIMAL
  level, even during system or service failures.

- Admins can override support policies—including instant lock to FULL or
  MINIMAL for maintenance or incident response.

- All errors or policy breaches are escalated via admin dashboard and
  alerts.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clear, color-coded indicator for AI help mode.

- Accessibility compliant with status readouts for screen readers.

- Real-time updates from ramp-up engine for immediate feedback.

- Simple admin configuration with threshold sliders and test/diagnostic
  tools.

## Narrative

During a major incident on a trading floor, analysts face mounting
pressure: deadlines tighten, information overload spikes, and the cost
of any mistake rises dramatically. Traditionally, even the best
knowledge workers falter—delays, oversight, or critical errors can creep
in just when stakes are highest.

The Pressure-to-Performance Transformation Engine silently monitors all
users, looking for signs of cognitive overload—slow reaction times,
rising error counts, or even stress signals detected through real-time
telemetry. The instant it detects pressure climbing, the engine ramps up
AI support automatically. Transcription becomes more detailed, pattern
recognition sharpens, memory recall is instant—all without any action
from stressed users. As the crisis passes, AI help wanes, but never
drops below a minimum safety net. Operations leads watch mode flips and
audit logs, knowing the system is always as helpful as needed. The
result: fewer errors, faster recovery, and a calm, supported
workforce—even when things get wild.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
