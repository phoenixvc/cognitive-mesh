# Mesh-Level Orchestration & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration PRD

### TL;DR

A robust Kubernetes-based orchestration layer for the Cognitive Mesh coordinates all Exponential Ideaflow engines—generation, filtering, creativity, taste, recursive improvement—to ensure every workflow flows through both AI and human-in-the-loop stages. The orchestrator enforces real-time oversight, guarantees auditability, and logs every event and checkpoint. All mesh operations are observable, permissioned, and integrated with RBAC, security, and enterprise compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Guarantee 100% of critical AI workflows traverse the complete ideaflow pipeline—no black-box, skipped, or shadow processes.
- Enforce compliance, audit, and safety at every workflow break point (automated and human).
- Support rapid innovation cycles while maintaining enterprise certainty and traceability.

### User Goals
- Mesh operators can see and control all running jobs, approve, pause, resume, or abort any workflow in real time.
- Data scientists and engineers gain fine-grained visibility into every model's journey through the mesh, with notification of human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints and decisions.
- All platform users enjoy clarity on when and why intervention is required, reducing operational risk.

### Non-Goals
- Does not perform specialized AI/model evaluation (delegated to mesh engines).
- Does not serve as a user-facing analytics dashboard (delivers data but not end-user reporting).
- Does not directly expose low-level mesh or infrastructure controls (scoped to orchestration/workflow governance).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.
- Platform Operators: monitor and control mesh workflows in real-time.
- Data Scientists: track model journeys and HITL checkpoints.
- Compliance Leads: ensure audit trails and regulatory compliance.
- Developers: programmatically launch and monitor mesh workflows.
- Security Team: enforce RBAC and access controls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories
- As an operator, I need to track, approve, or halt any mesh workflow at any time—knowing where and why intervention is required.
- As a data scientist, I want to know my model's journey through the mesh, including when HITL checkpoints occurred and what actions were taken.
- As a compliance lead, I require a full audit trail for every orchestration sequence, with RBAC enforcement, all trigger points, and recorded decisions.
- As a developer, I want programmatic APIs to launch and monitor end-to-end mesh workflows with clear status at every stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements
- **Orchestrator Deployment:** Orchestrator service runs as a Kubernetes pod (AKS/Helm) and triggers/routes all AI engine jobs (generation→filtering→creativity→taste→improvement cycle).
- **Stepwise Validation & Audit:** Each step in the workflow is validated and its status/state/timing is logged to an audit store.
- **Configurable HITL Checkpoints:** Human-in-the-Loop checkpoints are dynamically configured by risk, compliance needs, or user/role; triggering notifications (dashboard widget, email, Slack/webhook).
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST /pipeline/run: Start a new end-to-end workflow, returns orchestrationID.
  - GET /pipeline/status/{id}: Retrieve current status, next required action, history.
  - POST /pipeline/stop: Pause or abort a workflow, capturing user, time, and reason.
  - GET /pipeline/logs/{id}: Fetch full execution/audit log as events/timeline.
- **API Contract Enforcement:** All endpoints enforce a shared envelope (error_code, message, correlationID, data) and versioned JSON schemas.
- **Intervention Controls:** At any stage, authorized users can pause, resume, or abort jobs, with cause and actor logged.
- **Live Dashboard Integration:** All mesh workflows and statuses, with intervention controls, are visualized in a dashboard widget consumable by PluginOrchestrator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements
- ≥99.9% uptime for all orchestration and HITL endpoints.
- 100% audit trail coverage for all workflow events and interventions.
- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Real-time workflow status updates with <5 second latency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience
**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**
- Operators or developers access the orchestrator via secured dashboard or API client.
- The first-time user sees only authorized jobs and workflows; onboarding wizard guides through core controls (e.g., launching jobs, monitoring, intervention).

**Core Experience**
- **Step 1:** User (operator/developer/agent) initiates a workflow by submitting a mesh job with required metadata via POST /pipeline/run.
  - Validate input and role permissions.
  - Return orchestrationID for tracking.
- **Step 2:** Workflow progresses engine-to-engine as designed; each stage logged with timestamp, correlationID, actor, and state.
  - Dashboard displays real-time status, next stage, and any pending approvals.
- **Step 3:** If HITL checkpoint is configured for the current job, orchestrator notifies the responsible user group/role via widget notification and/or async channel (email, webhook).
  - Await approval, rejection, or additional info.
  - Every HITL action is logged and auditable.
- **Step 4:** Operator/admin can pause, resume, or abort the workflow at any stage using POST /pipeline/stop.
  - All interventions logged with who/when/why.
- **Step 5:** GET /pipeline/status/{id} provides a live view of pipeline state, with historic and next actions, and triggers notifications as needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative
Imagine Maria, the lead AI Ops engineer, is preparing for a routine compliance audit. With a live dashboard powered by the orchestration layer, she can see every AI workflow traversing the mesh—from initial generation through filtering, creativity, taste assessment, and recursive improvement. Each stage is logged, each HITL checkpoint is documented, and every intervention is traceable. When a high-risk workflow approaches a critical decision point, the system automatically notifies the appropriate stakeholders, ensuring human oversight where required. The result: complete transparency, full compliance, and the confidence that no AI process operates without proper governance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics
- 100% of critical AI workflows traverse the complete ideaflow pipeline.
- Compliance audit pass rate and regulatory approval success.
- User satisfaction with workflow visibility and control capabilities.
- Cross-team adoption of HITL checkpoints and intervention protocols.
- Real-time workflow monitoring and intervention effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tracking Plan
- Track workflow execution, HITL checkpoints, and intervention events.
- Monitor compliance audit outcomes and regulatory approvals.
- Log all orchestration decisions and user interventions.
- Track cross-team adoption and workflow governance effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Architecture & Integrations
- **Kubernetes Orchestrator:** Containerized orchestration service managing all AI engine workflows.
- **HITL Checkpoint Manager:** Dynamic configuration and enforcement of human oversight points.
- **Audit Service:** Immutable logging for all workflow events and interventions.
- **RBAC Engine:** Role-based access control and permission management.
- **Dashboard Widget:** Real-time visualization of workflow status and intervention controls.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST /pipeline/run: Workflow initiation
  - GET /pipeline/status/{id}: Status monitoring
  - POST /pipeline/stop: Workflow control
  - GET /pipeline/logs/{id}: Audit trail access
- **Notification Service:** Real-time alerts for HITL checkpoints and workflow events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Python backend (FastAPI recommended), orchestrated with Temporal for
  auditability and HITL checkpointing.

- AKS/Helm pod deployment with readiness/liveness probes.

- PostgreSQL (preferred) or CosmosDB for persistent workflow state, job
  metadata, and full audit logs.

### Integration Points

- Exposes JSON-based APIs for PluginOrchestrator and custom dashboard
  widgets.

- Receives and emits events via Azure Service Bus/Event Grid for HITL,
  pauses, and status changes; integrates with Flexible Notification
  adapters (Email, Slack, Webhook).

- RBAC implemented via Azure AD; all tokens/credentials managed in Azure
  Key Vault.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All job, event, and intervention data stored in the orchestrator DB,
  retention policy in line with org compliance (e.g., 90-day
  traceability).

- Sensitive actions (pause, override, abort) log the identity and
  justification; PII masked where not operationally required.

### Scalability & Performance

- Service auto-scales with AKS pod scaling; dashboard and widget
  endpoints rate-limited per user/team.

- Queue-backed job buffering for burst load (\>1000 concurrent
  workflows).

- Orchestrator failover with no data loss (persistent workflow and state
  store).

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring that complex, multi-party HITL workflows respect RBAC without
  false positives or missed steps.

- Distributed tracing of engine-to-engine data flows and correlating
  with HITL actions in the audit log.

- Graceful recovery from orchestrator pod/service failure during
  long-running mesh jobs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
