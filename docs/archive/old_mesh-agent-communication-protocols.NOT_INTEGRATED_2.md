# Mesh Agent Communication Protocols & Integration PRD

### TL;DR

The MetacognitiveLayer enables agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-to-tool
interactions using a range of standardsâ€”ontology-based ACLs (FIPA-ACL,
KQML), natural language protocols (NLIP), function-calling, and modern
REST/gRPC transports. All protocols will be mesh-discoverable,
auditable, secure, and context-rich. This allows Cognitive Mesh agents
to orchestrate, negotiate, and operationalize workflows
flexiblyâ€”internally and with external agent ecosystems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Seamlessly orchestrate workload and negotiation among internal and
  third-party agents for rapid, reliable business outcomes.

- Ensure all agent communication within and across the mesh is
  traceable, secure, and policy-compliant for regulatory peace of mind.

- Unblock engineering velocity by making it trivial to add new
  agent/communication protocols as the ecosystem evolves.

### User Goals

- Empower operators and developers to discover, configure, and
  prioritize agent protocols in the meshâ€”fast and with minimal learning
  curve.

- Enable agents to find and speak the right "language" with minimal
  friction, optimizing for the best workflow or external integration.

- Offer real-time observability, error feedback, and failover so users
  trust the agent mesh in critical business flows.

### Non-Goals

- Building or maintaining "homegrown" communication languages outside
  open standards.

- Supporting protocols that lack baseline security (no mTLS/JWT) or
  registry/audit compatibility.

- Directly supporting ultra-niche (research-only) agent frameworks not
  aligned with the long-term mesh vision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Mesh Operators: enable/disable protocols, enforce compliance.

- Agent Developers: register and integrate agent protocols.

- Integrators: connect external agent frameworks.

- End Users: benefit from orchestrated agent workflows.

- QA/Test Automation: validate protocol reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Mesh Operator**

- As an operator, I want to enable or disable agent communication
  protocols for each workspace, so I can enforce compliance and
  performance.

- As an operator, I want to view which agents support which protocols,
  so I can plan secure, efficient workflows.

- As an operator, I want to audit agent-to-agent/tool message logs, so I
  can trace issues or satisfy compliance checks.

**Agent Developer**

- As an agent developer, I want to declare supported ACLs/protocols and
  register with the mesh, so external agents can reliably integrate with
  my services.

- As an agent developer, I want to leverage mesh-managed context frames
  and transport security, so I can focus on agent logic, not plumbing.

**End User/Integrator**

- As an end user, I want to chain multiple agents using their preferred
  communication style, so I can automate work without protocol
  translation.

- As an integrator, I want to connect external agent frameworks (e.g.,
  JADE, Aries, LangChain) with minimal code, so I accelerate
  time-to-value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **ACL/Conversation-Standard Messaging** (Priority: Must)

  - Envelope supports performative (inform, request, query),
    sender/receiver, ontology ID, conversationId.

  - Mesh schemas (ACP/MCP) formally support ACL headers with
    validator/handlers.

  - FIPA-ACL, KQML standards built into protocol plugins.

- **Secure A2A Protocols (DIDComm, mTLS/JWT)** (Priority: Must)

  - Every A2A call is mTLS/JWT secured; each message is signed,
    audit-logged, and rejects unregistered senders.

  - Message signing/verification, circuit-breaker, fallback/handoff to
    human queue.

- **NLIP/Natural-Language/Function Calling** (Priority: Must)

  - Handler for schema-less NLIP payloads; Registry supports OpenAI
    Function Calling, Semantic Kernel, etc.

  - NLIP handler pluggable; allows mixed natural language and structured
    JSON.

- **REST/gRPC & Pub/Sub Transports** (Priority: Must)

  - Every agent or connector declares supported transports (REST, gRPC,
    Pub/Sub).

  - Health/metrics endpoints provided per transport, support for batch,
    buffering, and backoff.

  - Support for Kafka, MQTT, and DDS as pub/sub/syndication layer for
    swarms.

- **Shared Context Frames** (Priority: Must)

  - Every comm (A2A or A2T) can include a ContextFrame (beliefs, goals,
    provenance, memory, provenance, etc.) in arbitrary JSON.

  - ContextFrame Serializer/Deserializer required; ties directly to
    MeshMemoryStore.

- **Policy, Circuit-Breaker, Fallback, and Audit Enforcement**

  - All protocols and handlers must comply with mesh's NFRs for
    failover, fallback, and audit trail.

- **Mesh Registry Extensions** (Priority: Must)

  - Each protocol/handler appears in the Mesh Registry with: name,
    priority (must/should/could), schemaVersion, supported transports,
    endpoints for health/metrics/version/schema.

  - All agents and external adapters can discover and negotiate
    supported protocols during registration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- â‰¥99.9% uptime for all protocol and registry endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all agent communication events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Operators access the Mesh Registry dashboard to enable/disable protocols and review agent registrations.

- Developers register agents and declare supported protocols via API or UI.

- Integrators connect external frameworks using registry-discovered protocols.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Operator configures protocol support for a workspace.

  - Mesh Registry updates available protocols and agent compatibility.

- **Step 2:** Agents communicate using selected protocols; all messages are signed, logged, and auditable.

- **Step 3:** Users and integrators chain agents and tools using preferred protocols; errors and fallbacks are surfaced in real time.

- **Step 4:** Compliance and security teams audit message logs and protocol usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

A mesh operator at a large enterprise needs to orchestrate workflows across internal and third-party agents. Using MeshAgentCommunicationProtocols, she enables FIPA-ACL and REST for her workspace. Agent developers register their services, declaring supported protocols. As agents communicate, all messages are signed, logged, and auditable. When a new external framework is integrated, the registry negotiates protocol compatibility. The result: secure, flexible, and transparent agent orchestration across the Cognitive Mesh.
