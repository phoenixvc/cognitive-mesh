# Taste-as-a-Service Architecture PRD

### TL;DR

Org-specific, domain-trainable taste models evaluate the "fit" of all AI outputs—ensuring aesthetics, culture, and domain alignment at machine speed. All business lines get tailored evaluation, armed with feedback loops and versioning to continuously improve AI quality and trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Achieve a 40% reduction in AI output rework or manual overrides.
- Ensure all AI-generated assets align with brand, culture, and regional norms.
- Expand coverage so every domain/org has at least one tailored taste model in production.
- Raise human satisfaction on AI-driven outputs by a measurable margin (+30%).

### User Goals
- Users trust that recommendations, content, prototypes, and other outputs match their context and standards.
- Rapid, objective, and consistent scoring of "fit" available on demand.
- Domain owners can codify, update, and enforce high standards for "what good looks like."
- Transparent feedback and rollbacks if taste models fail to deliver.

### Non-Goals
- This system does not replace the human judgment for critical approvals (it augments/automates for scale).
- Not intended for fully subjective, personal taste evaluation (focuses on collective/organizational taste).
- No unsupervised, "black-box" model updates—always transparent, auditable changes with HITL checkpoints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.
- Product Owners: train domain-specific taste models and ensure brand alignment.
- Designers: evaluate prototypes and creative assets for aesthetic and cultural fit.
- AI Engineers: manage taste model updates and versioning.
- Domain Experts: provide feedback and calibration for taste models.
- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories
- As a Product Owner, I want to train a finance-domain taste model so our AI outputs are always on-brand and compliant, reducing manual rework.
- As a Product Owner, when I roll out a new AI workflow, I want assurance that generated summaries will suit the intended audience without awkward phrasing or tone.
- As a Designer, I want to submit a new prototype or creative asset for instant evaluation and receive aesthetic, cultural, and relevance scores for rapid iteration.
- As a Designer, I want to provide direct feedback on model fit to recalibrate future evaluations.
- As an AI Engineer, I want to update taste models and ensure prior versions are archived so we can roll back if performance drops.
- As an AI Engineer, I want clear API contracts and audit trails for every evaluation and model change, ensuring compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements
- **Taste Model Training:** POST /taste/train: Train or update a model with labeled positive/negative examples, recording version, domain, and context with each new/updated model.
- **Taste Evaluation:** POST /taste/evaluate: Evaluate candidate output against relevant taste models, returning multi-dimensional "fit" scores (aesthetic, cultural, context) with clear reason codes.
- **Model Versioning & Rollback:** POST /taste/model/{domain}: Update, retrieve, or rollback models by namespace/domain, with all changes logged and ability to restore previous working model.
- **Cultural Context Enrichment:** Auto-enrichment of taste scoring with cultural/compliance context (e.g., using Hofstede or org-provided metrics) handled transparently by on-mesh context plugin (MCP).
- **Feedback Loop:** POST /taste/feedback: Submit real human feedback (e.g., "fit," relevance, satisfaction) for model recalibration, incorporating user/owner feedback to weight/retrain models.
- **Standard Error Envelope:** Every API responds with { error_code, message, correlationID, data } to enforce consistent, transparent errors and traceability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements
- ≥99.9% uptime for all taste evaluation and model training endpoints.
- 100% audit trail coverage for all taste evaluations and model changes.
- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Taste evaluation response time <150ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience
**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**
- Users (Product Owners, Designers, Engineers) discover the "Taste Panel" via dashboard widget or Business Application interface.
- First-time users are prompted to select a domain and supply gold-standard examples (e.g., "good/bad" outputs for training).
- Quick onboarding guide walks users through model training and how to interpret scores.

**Core Experience**
- **Step 1:** User or service submits content for evaluation (API or widget).
  - Required fields: content string/asset, intended domain, context, and optional extra metadata.
  - Backend: Model routes to correct domain/model; returns fit scores (<150ms).
  - UI: Widget displays a breakdown (aesthetic fit, cultural fit, context match, overall score), highlights areas for improvement.
- **Step 2:** User can view "Why?" explainer (lists key factors/contexts impacting the score).
- **Step 3:** If score is unsatisfactory, user can submit feedback ("missed nuance," "off-brand," etc.)—which is logged and may be incorporated into the next model update.
- **Step 4:** Domain owners or AI engineers can retrain or rollback models via the admin dashboard or API, with every version logged and revertible.
- **Step 5:** All operations are fully auditable in the admin log; notification banners inform users of new model versions or major updates.

## Narrative
Patricia is a Product Owner for a global payments platform launching a new AI-powered content generator. She's concerned about the system suggesting headlines or product copy that might be off-message or culturally inappropriate. With Taste-as-a-Service, Patricia trains a finance-domain taste model using examples of approved content, ensuring all AI-generated outputs align with brand standards and regulatory requirements. The system provides instant evaluation of AI outputs, reducing manual review time while maintaining quality and compliance across all markets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- **Model:** PyTorch built, ONNX-exported for portable runtime; baseline as a custom MLP or fine-tuned OSS classifier per domain.

- **Inference API:** Fast, async web service (suggest FastAPI) containerized for AKS; REST and gRPC supported.

- **Vector DB:** Weaviate (recommended—seamless plugin model and mesh-native APIs, privacy-friendly), Pinecone as a fallback.

- **Cultural Context Plugin:** Embedded MCP/ACP plugin to inject up-to-date culture/region metadata per org/domain.

- **Model Registry & Versioning:** Model artifacts (with hash, metadata) stored encrypted in Azure Blob; config and pointers in CosmosDB; full history tracked.

- **Audit & Metrics:** Azure Monitor for logs/event streams; Prometheus/Grafana for latency and error rates.

### Integration Points

- Consumes output for evaluation from Business Applications, Reasoning Layer, Agency Layer, and external services via REST/gRPC.

- Live widget/feedback integrated into Cognitive Mesh dashboard via PluginOrchestrator, enforcing separation, validation, and approvals.

- Secure RBAC gates for training/rollback; open evaluation per-org policy.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No persistent storage of user content—only metadata, model artifacts, and user feedback.

- All model artifacts, logs, and feedback events encrypted at rest.

- Role-based access and human-in-the-loop enforced on all write/change operations.

- PII/data compliance: all content/scoring non-identifiable by design.

### Scalability & Performance

- Kubernetes-managed horizontal autoscaling for peak eval or multi-model concurrency.

- Memory hard limits (500MB/model), with burst scaling for big orgs.

- Batch/stream APIs for high-throughput orgs; built-in circuit breakers for failed model loads.

### Potential Challenges

- Complex or ambiguous domains may require extended training/feedback for quality.

- Cultural fit scoring is only as strong as provided context/exemplar data.

- Model drift: Continuous monitoring, quick rollback critical.

- User education: Widget must clearly surface the meaning and "grain of salt" risks with AI-driven scores.
