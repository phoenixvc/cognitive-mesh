------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all experimentation and execution endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all experiment runs and safety events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Variant generation response time <200ms, result retrieval <1s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the platform via a dashboard, CLI, or mesh API
  documentation.

- First-time users are guided by onboarding pop-ups explaining variant
  generation, safety controls, and result interpretation.

- Security/auth required for "batch" or "dangerous" experiment rights;
  RBAC interface to request elevated privileges.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User submits a domain prompt and combinator settings via
  UI or POST /experiment/generate.

  - UI has input validation and a submission spinner.

  - Errors in prompt or rules are flagged with hints.

  - On success, the system confirms that 1k+ variants have been
    generated in under 200 ms.

- **Step 2:** User reviews the variant list, optionally making edits.

- **Step 3:** User triggers batch execution with POST
  /experiment/batch/run; jobID returned instantly.

  - System provides a "live" job monitor with progress, resource use,
    and ETA.

- **Step 4:** User checks experiment outcomes with GET
  /experiment/results/{jobID}; full report delivered (P99 \<1 s).

  - Results show detailed scores, outliers, and auto-notifications of
    errors or warnings.

- **Step 5 (Advanced):** User fetches top-N synthesized learnings via
  GET /experiment/synthesis/{jobID} for executive summary and action.

- **Step 6:** If job or cluster load spikes, system provides stop/abort
  interface and alerts the user.

  - User sees confirmation, and audit log records the event.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can schedule recurring experiments and combine reports.

- Errors: If an experiment fails or times out, user receives an inline
  reason and retry advice.

- All system-side events are logged and traceable by jobID and
  correlationID.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clear confirmation at each action with estimated time to result.

- Accessible: Fully keyboard navigable, color-blind safe, and responsive
  design.

- Prominent safety buttons (abort/stop) visible on all batch screens for
  eligible users.

- Tooltips and documentation links to help users interpret synthesis and
  top‑K outputs.

## Narrative

When a product lead at your company proposes a "crazy" but exciting
idea, they're accustomed to weeks of hand-wringing before real data
emerges. Instead, with the Exponential Experimentation Engine, they
submit the idea in the dashboard. In seconds, they see a thousand
AI-generated variants—whimsical, bold, and pragmatic. The system executes all variants in parallel, delivering actionable results in minutes rather than weeks. This radical acceleration transforms innovation from a slow, cautious process into a rapid, data-driven exploration of possibilities, enabling teams to "test the crazy" and discover breakthrough solutions at superhuman speed.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Microservice deployed on Kubernetes, exposed via OpenAPI 3 endpoints

- Container image with autoscale profile for CPU/GPU node pools

- Async batch orchestrator (e.g., Celery, Dask, or Ray) with parallel
  dispatch and resource capping

- Persistent store for job/experiment metadata, user actions, and audit
  logs—preferably a scalable transactional DB

- RBAC: Use Azure Active Directory for security token issuance;
  fine-grained role mappings

### Integration Points

- Azure Key Vault for secrets/certificates

- Prometheus and Grafana for observability and alerting

- Mesh dashboard and developer CLIs (API-first integration)

- Optional: Batch job orchestration with Azure Batch Pools for very
  large workloads

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All experiment metadata, results, and logs encrypted at rest
  (Azure-managed)

- User-specific access to job outputs; only admins/owners can see all
  jobs

- Full audit log for compliance and security review

- Data retention policy configurable by project/org

### Scalability & Performance

- Should handle up to 1,000 concurrent experiments with seamless
  autoscale

- Support job resumption and graceful failure/retry on infrastructure
  hiccups

### Potential Challenges

- Preventing accidental or malicious resource exhaustion

- Real-time monitoring/alerting on runaway experiments or abnormal costs

- Ensuring actionable synthesis (not just raw data) in every large batch

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium Project: 4 weeks end-to-end for fully functional alpha with
  basic RBAC and observability

  API gateway).

- Pull configuration/secrets from Azure Key Vault—no plaintext
  credentials or tokens in containers.

- Use Prometheus for in-depth metrics; Grafana for real-time dashboards;
  Alertmanager for ops notifications.

- Distribute kill-switch/in-task abort capability to both ops and senior
  users, with strict audit trials and cooldowns.

- Integrate mesh dashboard widgets for easy experiment submission and
  monitoring—everything API-first.

- Implement retries/backoffs and automatic circuit-breakers against
  cascading failures.
