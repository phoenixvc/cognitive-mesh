# AI Usage Heatmap & Automated Coaching Layer (Cognitive Mesh)

### TL;DR

The AI Usage Heatmap & Automated Coaching Layer is an analytics engine
and widget suite for Cognitive Mesh. It visualizes AI feature usage and
maturity adoption patterns across organizations and individuals,
surfaces hotspots and gaps, and delivers data-driven, personalized
coaching. These insights enable real-time interventions, continuous
organizational learning, and accelerate user growth along the AI
maturity curve.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Drive higher AI maturity across all users and teams

- Optimize adoption and spread of advanced AI features and maturity best
  practices

- Enable precise, targeted enablement by surfacing usage blindspots and
  high-performing areas

- Support measurable improvement in AI risk, transparency, and ethical
  use through guided interventions

### User Goals

- Empower users and teams to understand their AI usage and maturity
  patterns

- Deliver personalized, actionable coaching addressing individual
  maturity gaps

- Support managers and admins with organizational maturity coverage
  dashboards

- Foster a culture of learning and improvement around AI usage

### Non-Goals

- Does not enforce hard rate-limits or punitive sanctions by default
  (API throttling is optional, supporting only guided improvement)

- Does not duplicate XP, level, or badge mechanics (handled by
  gamification engine)

- Not intended to replace detailed platform audit logs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Admins: monitor usage and enablement.

- Enablement Teams: deliver coaching and support.

- Regular Users: receive coaching and feedback.

- Managers: review team/org maturity and drive improvement.

- Data Stewards: ensure privacy and compliance.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a **Platform Admin**, I want to see heatmaps of AI tool usage,
  identifying feature adoption, maturity gaps, and areas that need
  enablement action.

- As a **Regular User**, I want contextual coaching nudges ("try
  explainability next!") based on my activity, so I can level up
  efficiently.

- As a **Manager**, I want dashboards showing how our team/organization
  aligns with the maturity model so I can offer support or drive
  incentives.

- As a **Data Steward**, I want all recommendations and data flows
  compliant with privacy/security policy, only surfacing aggregated or
  anonymized insights where needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Usage Event Aggregator**

  - Collects granular, real-time AI feature and API activity per
    user/team/org, tagged to maturity model dimensions (time, feature,
    maturity step, etc.)

  - Supports batch and streaming ingestion for surface analytics

- **Heatmap API** (/usage/heatmap)

  - Exposes endpoints for querying usage "density" (per user, org,
    feature, time window)

  - Returns trends, comparative overlays, and change detection

- **Coaching Engine**

  - Runs periodic and triggered analysis to find maturity gaps and
    underused capabilities

  - Generates personalized, actionable "next step" suggestions

  - Delivered through Coaching Feed, Widget Inbox, or Notifications

- **Automated Alert/Notification Stream**

  - Pushes coaching nudges, achievement tips, and coverage insights to
    users and administrators via widgets

- **Dashboard Widgets** (frontend/plugins for UI Layer)

  - **Org-wide Heatmap Widget:** Aggregates usage by team/department;
    highlights maturity gaps

  - **My Usage Map:** Visualizes individual user's activity pathway
    against maturity model

  - **Coaching Feed/Inbox Widget:** Lists tailored improvement
    recommendations, actionable tips, and milestones

- **Optional: Maturity-Aware API Rate Limiting**

  - Adaptive guides that recommend, warn, or gently throttle API usage
    for users with persistent maturity issues (only if enabled)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- â‰¥99.9% uptime for all widget and API endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all usage and coaching events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users and admins access the dashboard from the main Cognitive Mesh UI
  Layer (Plugin Marketplace).

- First-time users see an onboarding tip about the meaning and value of
  heatmaps and coaching, including privacy commitments.

- Widgets are personalized to show only relevant data (respecting user
  role and permissions).

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User/admin selects the "AI Usage Heatmap" dashboard or
  adds the heatmap widget through the Plugin Marketplace.

  - Widget loads, fetching authenticated usage/event data via the
    PluginOrchestrator (BFF).

  - Start with a high-level mapâ€”defaulting to last 7 days of activity.

- **Step 2:** User interacts with the map: filters by feature, maturity
  step, or time; overlays team/department

  - Trend lines, color coding, and tooltips highlight densest features,
    unused areas.

- **Step 3:** Individual users access the "My Usage Map" widget.

  - See a journey visualization of their recent feature use and current
    maturity level.

  - Gaps and next-step prompts are visually highlighted.

- **Step 4:** Coaching Engine runs (scheduled or event-triggered).

  - Finds users whose usage lags in specific maturity model dimensions
    (e.g., rarely using explainability tools).

  - Delivers a coaching suggestion or actionable tip to the user's
    Coaching Feed/Inbox widget.

- **Step 5:** User clicks a recommendation to view more detail, launches
  suggested feature, or dismisses it as "not relevant."

  - Action is logged for follow-up analytics.

- **Step 6:** Admin views organization-wide maturity coverage via Org
  Heatmap and associated trend widgets. Can export anonymized coverage
  metrics for quarterly review.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can opt-in to more granular breakdowns or download
  anonymized CSVs

- Widgets degrade gracefully (error boundary) on backend latency/API
  failures, using the shared error envelope

- If Coaching Engine finds all maturity boxes checked,
  "Congratulations!" message shownâ€”plus encouragement to coach others

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Responsive, colorblind-accessible heatmaps and clear, contrasting
  coach prompts

------------------------------------------------------------------------
