# Proactive Disruption Intelligence PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

Build an anticipatory disruption and risk engine to proactively detect,
assess, and respond to external AI-driven threats and competitive
pressures. Leverages LangChain agents for scanning and competitive
analysis, calibrates risk scoring with Ray RLlib, tracks and iterates
models using Weights & Biases, and supports local LLMs for confidential
or sovereign data needs. All core elements run in Azure AKS via
Helm/Bicep; dashboards, widgets, and APIs consume and visualize the
data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Reduce the incidence of unanticipated AI-driven disruptions by 50%
  over twelve months.

- Elevate the organization from reactive to proactive risk management
  strategy.

- Achieve ≥60% follow-through on recommended response/mitigation plans
  after alerting on new threats.

- Attain 'confidence in risk insight' user NPS ≥4.0/5.0 on a monthly
  rolling average.

### User Goals

- Deliver timely, actionable, confidence-scored risk insights.

- Enable localized, private, and auditable risk analysis.

- Allow users to provide feedback that directly sharpens the engine's
  accuracy over time.

- Provide clear transformation roadmaps when threats are detected.

### Non-Goals

- Does not manage in-depth forensic analysis post-breach (focus is
  proactive, not incident response).

- Not intended for compliance or regulatory risk scoring outside
  competitive transformation contexts.

- Excludes manual data entry—system is driven by automated scanning and
  API ingestion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Senior Leaders: review executive dashboards and make strategic decisions.

- Security Leads: run local risk assessments and monitor threat intelligence.

- Platform Users: receive risk insights and transformation plans.

- Platform Engineers: maintain infrastructure and deployment.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a **senior leader**, I want an executive dashboard of new and
  emerging AI-driven threats, so that I can make confident,
  forward-looking strategic decisions.

- As a **security or innovation lead**, I want to run full, local risk
  assessments using private models, so that sensitive data never leaves
  our Azure tenant.

- As a **platform user**, I want to see recommended transformation plans
  mapped to my area as soon as a relevant risk is detected, so I can act
  before disruption hits.

- As a **system**, I want to receive real-world event feedback and
  retrain my scoring/calibration engine automatically, so that my
  accuracy improves continuously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Disruption Threat Scanning (High Priority):**

  - LangChain Agents scan scheduled and on-demand sources (RSS feeds,
    GitHub, patents, job boards, press).

  - Memory chains build historical threat context.

- **Risk Scoring & Calibration (High Priority):**

  - Ray RLlib runs reinforcement learning self-play to continuously
    calibrate risk scoring.

  - Automated nightly retraining; calibration tracked in Weights &
    Biases.

- **Local LLM/Transformer Assessment (Medium Priority):**

  - User/tenant option: run Hugging Face models in Azure AKS for
    confidential data.

  - For less sensitive needs, switch to OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI
    Service.

- **Feedback Loop (Medium Priority):**

  - Capture user feedback on risk assessments and outcomes.

  - RLlib and W&B update the risk engine from real-world validations.

- **API Endpoints (Critical):**

  - POST /v1/disruption/assess: Run assessment, return vulnerabilities.

  - POST /v1/disruption/plan: Trigger and return transformation plan.

  - POST /v1/disruption/feedback: Accepts real-world event data to
    update calibration.

  - GET /v1/disruption/threats: Returns most recent threat intelligence.

  - GET /v1/disruption/calibration: Provides model metrics and
    calibration accuracy.

- **Platform & Infrastructure (Critical):**

  - All major services containerized; deployed to AKS with Helm and
    managed by Bicep.

  - Secrets and API keys in Azure Key Vault.

  - Widgets, dashboards, Slack/email bots as thin API consumers only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all disruption intelligence and risk assessment endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all threat scans and risk assessments.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Threat scanning and risk assessment response time <300ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the disruption dashboard via the secure mesh portal or a
  custom widget in their usual dashboard.

- On first access, an onboarding guide explains real-time and scheduled
  threat scanning, feedback provision, and where to review/act on
  recommendations.

- Users may opt into local-only risk processing for confidential
  analysis. Consent for remote LLM/AI usage is surfaced as a setting.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User logs in to the dashboard or loads the widget.

  - Receives a summary "risk radar" view: new threats, confidence
    scores, high-priority transformation suggestions.

  - All data is shown in real-time, with clear timestamps and
    versioning.

- **Step 2:** User can drill into individual threat assessments.

  - Views the assessment chain-of-thought, confidence scores, and
    recommendation rationale (enhances trust and transparency).

- **Step 3:** User can trigger a new on-demand risk assessment or
  transformation plan generation.

  - System runs the LangChain agent scan, updates RLlib-calibrated
    assessments, and presents a proposed plan.

- **Step 4:** User or admin provides feedback post-implementation or in
  light of new events.

  - Feedback pipeline updates RLlib model in the next retraining cycle
    and logs result in W&B.

- **Step 5:** User can review calibration accuracy, trends, and model
  diagnostics from a transparent admin page.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Full switch to only-local LLM/AI for highly restricted data or to meet
  sovereign cloud mandates.

- Automated fallback and user notification if a remote LLM is
  unavailable or slow.

- Audit logging of all scans and model decisions for compliance.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clean separation between risk "summary," "explore deep dives," and
  "action planning."

- All recommendations clearly time-stamped and versioned.

- Real-time error notifications and error envelopes for all API
  interactions.

- WCAG accessibility standard compliance; responsive for desktop and
  tablet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

A senior leader at a global enterprise receives a real-time alert about a new AI-driven competitive threat. The Proactive Disruption Intelligence engine has scanned external sources, assessed the risk, and generated a transformation plan. The leader reviews the confidence score, rationale, and recommended actions, then assigns the plan to the relevant team. As the organization acts, feedback is logged, and the risk engine retrains to improve future accuracy, keeping the enterprise ahead of disruption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in unanticipated AI-driven disruptions (target: 50% decrease).

- Follow-through rate on recommended response/mitigation plans (target: ≥60%).

- User NPS for confidence in risk insight (target: ≥4.0/5.0).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Integration Strategy

- **LangChain Agents**: Orchestrate dynamic threat scanning,
  memory/stateful historical chains.

- **Ray RLlib**: Reinforcement learning calibration of risk scoring.
  Highly scalable, distributed; outperforms Stable Baselines3 for
  Azure-native workloads.

- **Weights & Biases**: Model and experiment meta-tracking (default);
  use MLflow if AzureML stack pre-existing.

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Local/air-gap LLM assessments for
  privacy; swap to Azure OpenAI Service or remote OpenAI if needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OSS/Service Alternatives & Recommendations

- **LangChain Agents**: Recommended for orchestration and modularity.
  Airflow is a secondary choice for lightweight ETL but lacks AI-native
  features.

- **Ray RLlib**: Preferred RL engine for distributed learning and
  integration with Azure. Stable Baselines3 is an option for small-scale
  POCs but not as scalable.

- **Weights & Biases**: Chosen for its multi-project support. MLflow is
  a satisfactory alternative for orgs standardizing on AzureML.

- **Hugging Face LLMs**: Essential for sovereignty and data privacy;
  Azure OpenAI Service preferred where policy allows.

All service containers are managed via Helm charts and Azure Bicep
templates. Client/dashboards consume only APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Layer Mapping & Shared Schemas

- **AKS/Helm/Bicep Pods:**

  - Risk scan, RLlib calibration/scoring, local LLM engine.

  - Ingress via Azure App Gateway or Istio, managed secrets in Azure Key
    Vault.

  - State and models in Azure Blob/Files.

- **API Consumers:**

  - Dashboards, widgets, Slack/email bots.

  - Fetch data from REST APIs, never require containerization.

- **Schemas/API Contracts:**

  - All endpoints return {error_code, message, correlationID, data}.

  - OpenAPI schema versions with model/data signatures for auditability.
