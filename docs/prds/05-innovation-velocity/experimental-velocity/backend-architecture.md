# Experimental Velocity Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered)

### TL;DR

This backend enables rapid experimental velocity, innovation theater
detection, and competitive-mindset recalibration across the Cognitive
Mesh. The architecture uses layered hexagonal boundaries:

- **ReasoningLayer:** Pure-logic experimental engines

- **BusinessApplications:** All API ports, adapters, retries, error
  handling, contract/versioning

- **FoundationLayer:** Audit/event logging, notification fan-out, DR/NFR

- **AgencyLayer:** Automated/agent support for velocity nudges and
  multi-agent orchestration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Multiply organizational experimental throughput 100x over traditional
  models

- Enable near real-time idea validation and cut prototyping budget by
  99%

- Eliminate "innovation theater" via measurable, auditable detection

- Equip leaders with competitive reality benchmarking to recalibrate
  investment assumptions

### User Goals

- Make experimentation and rapid prototyping possible for every
  product/project team

- Give clear, actionable feedback when processes drift into "theater"

- Provide transparent provenance and audit for every experiment &
  decision

- Instantly surface reality-checks and competitive performance gaps

### Non-Goals

- No UI widget or dashboard development (handled separately)

- No business workflow process logic or HR system integration

- Does not own analytical dashboards, but streams data for them

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Product Manager**

- As a Product Manager, I want to submit a prototype idea and receive
  recalibrated effort/cost estimates in real time, so my team can start
  building immediately.

- As a Product Manager, I want to receive alerts if our innovation
  process is detected as "theater" so we can course-correct early.

**Executive**

- As an Executive, I want competitive benchmarking against AI-enabled
  rivals so I can challenge teams that are working on obsolete
  timelines.

**Developer**

- As a Developer, I want transparent audit trails for every velocity
  recalibration and nudge so I can defend my work and backtrack
  decisions.

**Ops Lead**

- As an Ops Lead, I want to verify that all velocity and theater events
  are logged, queryable, and easily exportable for compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

### ReasoningLayer (Experimental Engines)

- **ExperimentalVelocityRecalibrationEngine** (Priority: Must)  
  -- Core recalibration logic exposed as strict interface  
  -- Given a project briefing, must return a recalibrated estimate
  (divide by 100 logic) in <200ms

- **InnovationTheaterEliminationEngine** (Priority: Must)  
  -- Analyzes process/project metadata, returns "theater risk score" in
  <100ms -- Acceptance: Given process metadata, returns score and cause
  analysis

- **CompetitiveRealityCheck** (Priority: Should)  
  -- Benchmarks current state vs. sector/AI-enabled orgs, flags
  competitive risk -- Acceptance: Given metrics, returns
  time/capacity/velocity gap within 300ms

- **Extensibility for AI/Nudge Agent Triggers** (Priority: Could)

### BusinessApplications (API and Adapter Ports)

- **REST/gRPC Ports** (Priority: Must)  
  -- All endpoints mapped to OpenAPI contract -- Acceptance: Given valid
  requests, correct response in <250ms 99% of time

- **Circuit Breaking/Retry** (Priority: Must)  
  -- REST adapters retry on transient backend error (max 2 attempts),
  trigger circuit breaker and log upon repeated failures

- **Error Shaping & Rate Limiting** (Priority: Must)  
  -- Standardized error envelope, accepts up to 10 requests/sec/user

- **Schema Evolution & Versioning** (Priority: Should)  
  -- API endpoints semantically versioned, schema changes by review only

### FoundationLayer (Outbound Adapters)

- **AuditLoggingAdapter** (Priority: Must)  
  -- Every core event (recalibration, theater flag, velocity nudge) is
  logged with provenance tags, available via search API within 5 minutes
  -- Acceptance: Given event, auditing chain is present and queryable

- **Notification/EventAdapter** (Priority: Must)  
  -- Must push notifications to mesh widget bus within 2 seconds of
  event -- DR/backup enforced as per NFR

- **Disaster Recovery, SLA Conformance** (Priority: Must)  
  -- DR tested quarterly, adapters must fallback or degrade gracefully
  in test scenarios

### AgencyLayer (Optional, for Agent/Bot Support)

- **AgencyAdapter** (Priority: Could)  
  -- Triggers velocity nudges or agent workflows upon defined event(s),
  async operation  
  -- Acceptance: Given eligible event, agent receives and acknowledges
  within 2 seconds

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users (PM, exec, developer) access APIs via secure mesh-wide
  authentication, or events are ingested programmatically

- No onboarding UX—this layer is API-only. All access and requests
  logged from first use.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User or system submits project proposal/experiment via API
  Adapter

  - Minimal validation, instant feedback on input shape

  - Contextual error responses on malformed input

  - Returns recalibrated velocity, unique tracking ID

- **Step 2:** "Theater" detection runs in parallel

  - If risk flagged, response includes warning with cause code

  - Optionally, escalates to AgencyAdapter for auto-nudge

- **Step 3:** All events (submitted, recalibrated, flagged, nudged)
  persist to audit log

  - Log record streams to search/export endpoint

- **Step 4:** If event triggers competitive risk,
  CompetitiveRealityCheck engine calculates gap

  - System returns gap details for dashboards, scores, or escalation

- **Step 5:** Widget or automated consumer receives notification/event
  push

  - Message includes tracking ID, provenance chain, actionable payload

- **Step X:** All exceptions/errors are logged, responses shaped per
  contracted envelope, retries managed by adapter logic

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Massive batch events processed with queue/de-dupe/aggregation
  strategies

- Circuit-break scenarios for ReasoningLayer overload; DR failover and
  notification

- Custom embed of "nudge" agents if AgencyLayer enabled; async or
  fallback as needed

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All outputs have clear, machine- and human-readable cause codes

- Error payloads offer actionable suggestions for fixing/re-trying API
  calls

- Provenance and consent always included in return metadata

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

The pace of innovation is now dictated by AI-powered competitors.
Product teams at VeritasVault.ai know every day lost to outdated
assumptions is a day closer to obsolescence. This backend architecture
empowers them—no matter their technical domain—to deliver experiments
100 times faster, challenge every old estimate, and prove (not just
claim) their impact. When a PM proposes a new feature, recalibration
logs an instant, defensible velocity target. If innovation "theater" is
detected, leadership receives targeted alerts, not vague reports. Every
action, every outcome, every decision is transparently logged and
auditable—enabling compliance, accountability, and a bias for real
experimentation. Over time, this shifts company DNA from process-worship
to outcome obsession, ensuring survival and market leadership amid rapid
AI transformation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Stateless domain core engines per strict interface contracts

- REST/gRPC API port exposure with mesh-wide authentication

- Adapter implementations for outbound logging, notification, DR and
  circuit breaking

### Integration Points

- Mesh event bus for notification/adaptor triggers

- OpenAPI contract for all APIs, versioned and registered centrally

- Multi-agent support via AgencyLayer (if used by customer orgs)

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All events, recalibrations, flags logged with full tenant scope,
  provenance, and consent chain

- Data lifecycle aligns with mesh-wide DR, compliance, and privacy
  policies

### Scalability & Performance

- System must handle >100x current proposal/test throughput with
  <250ms average response time

- Outbound adapters must scale horizontally and degrade gracefully under
  burst

### Potential Challenges

- New experimental velocity may outpace business process adaptation

- Risk of false positive "theater" warnings—tune feedback loop, allow
  override with audit

- Schema/contract evolution across mesh—requires strict governance and
  QA gate
