# Cognitive Mesh v3 Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Philosophically & Legally Sharpened)

### TL;DR

Mesh Widgets empower end-users to access the full v3 Cognitive Mesh
experience via modular, stepwise panels that orchestrate the Cognitive
Sandwich process, seamless sovereignty/fluency state transitions, legal
and cultural compliance, notification fatigue mitigation, consent/ethics
overlays, and advanced audit/provenance. Every widget rigorously
contracts to next-generation backend APIs, ensures exceptional
accessibility, global compliance, and real user research coverage for
enterprise and regulated deployments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Accelerate enterprise adoption of compliance-first,
  cognitive-sovereignty mesh interfaces globally.

- Reduce time-to-value for regulated or cross-cultural deployments by
  \>40% through widget configurability.

- Decrease risk and legal exposure by \>50% via audit/adapt overlays and
  in-context legal mitigation.

- Attain \>95% CI/CD test coverage and \<0.1% contract drift between
  widgets and backend releases.

### User Goals

- Give every user explicit cognitive leadership and feedback over any
  AI-augmented process.

- Provide preemptive legal, cultural, and fatigue warnings—reducing
  mistakes and boosting confidence.

- Ensure every action and override is always visible, revisitable, and
  justified in context.

- Create a stepwise experience that can always be paused, rewound, or
  augmented according to user and enterprise preference.

### Non-Goals

- Does not cover mobile-only/voice-only deployments (desktop widget
  suite focus).

- Does not develop custom widgets for non-compliant, non-enterprise, or
  unregulated environments.

- Does not automate human decision-making without sovereignty or
  step-back options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Senior Data Analyst (Marie)**

- As a Compliance Lead, I want overlays that flag legal or consent
  issues (GDPR, sectoral), so that I never miss an enterprise compliance
  requirement.

- As a Compliance Lead, I want to quickly audit all user actions,
  rationale, and step-backs for legal defense.

**Persona: Product Owner (Hui)**

- As a Product Owner, I want cultural adaptation panels that fit my
  team’s norms, so that UX is familiar whether we work in Germany or
  Singapore.

    rationale and action.

  - Every action, override, and rationale exposed in Audit/History
    panel.

- **Panel/Adapter Error Handling** (Priority: Must)

  - All widgets/overlays support pass, fail, contract drift, a11y error,
    step-back, fatigue, consent-denied, legal/policy block, and
    reconnect/offline events.

- **Panel Migration & Deprecation** (Priority: Must)

  - Panels that fall behind backend contract or legal config
    auto-disable and display migration overlay.

- **Team and Collaboration Panels** (Priority: Should)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users land on the configurable sandwich stepper with clear phase
  highlights and sovereignty state banner.

- Onboarding overlays surface first-time with context-aware tutorials
  (per role: Analyst, Compliance Lead, etc.).

- Any encountered legal/cultural/fatigue panels require “read &
  acknowledge” before access.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1: Human Analysis Panel**

  - User reads context, enters problem definition, rationale, and
    attaches supporting docs.

  - Can preview/submit or trigger a step-back to clarify.

  - All actions auto-saved and auditable.

- **Step 2: AI Processing Panel**

  - Suggestions from backend auto-populate, with
    transparency/traceability sidebars.

  - User reviews, requests more detail, or initiates
    clarification/feedback.

  - Legal consent panel triggers if required.

- **Step 3: Validation Panel**

  - User sees hypothesis/assumptions, triggers reflection/sanity check,
    and must pass precondition checklist for “next.”

  - Step-back and rationale always available; consent/ethics overlays
    triggered by context.

- **Step 4: Refinement Panel (Optional)**

  - Panel iterates on inputs and lets user/joint AI/agent review
    changes.

  - Fatigue banner/overlay triggers if cadence risk detected.

- **Step 5: Decision Authority Panel**

  - User selects/judges final option, assigns accountability, and sees
    summary of all rationale/feedback history.

  - System may require explicit legal/compliance banner click.

- **All Phases:**

  - “Step back” button always visible.

  - Status bar shows current sandwich, approval/cultural/agentic state.

  - All overlays and legal/cultural notifications override as required.

  - On submit, “next phase” blocked if pre/postconditions unmet (with
    explicit feedback).

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Panels dynamically adapt UI/language to culture and sector config
  (e.g., privacy in Germany, authority in Singapore).

- Reflection/fatigue overlays batch prompts if high-risk (“You have 12
  unread validations—review in bulk?”).

- Auto-disable and migration overlays if backend contract drift, with
  migration prompt and feedback.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All overlays/banners conform to AA accessibility; strong contrast,
  keyboard navigable.

- Locale, date, number, and policy info adjusted for user or org
  location.

- All panels sized ≤300kB, memory \<20MB, cold boot \<1s.

- Feedback and rationale routes are prominent and rapid.

- All legal, cultural, and fatigue overlays include clear acknowledgment
  and user audit logging.

## Narrative

Marie, a Senior Data Analyst in a Fortune 100 firm, prepares to run a
cross-regulatory dataset through her organization’s AI-augmented mesh
interface. The experience is nothing like opaque, one-shot AI platforms:
she is immediately welcomed by a clean stepper showing each required
cognitive phase, her sovereignty level, and a live status banner for her
unique cultural mode. As she progresses, the interface fluidly
adapts—triggering a legal overview when reviewing PII in Europe, and
batch fatigue notifications during late hours to help her prioritize.
When the AI makes an unexpected recommendation, Marie seamlessly steps
back, reviews her rationale, and invokes a team feedback panel—capturing
traceable actions for both compliance leads and executive review.

What might have been an overwhelming or risky operation is now a
structured, auditable, and adaptive journey. The mesh widgets deliver
deep oversight, global compliance, cognitive freedom, and audit
resilience—securing positive outcomes for users and the business alike.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- DataAPIAdapterPort for every phase, panel, and overlay, tightly
  contract-matched and CI-testable

- Consent, legal, and cultural adapters for real-time overlays and
  policy injection.

- Event-driven telemetry with flush within 10s of user action or
  overlay.

### Integration Points

- Backend v3 OpenAPI (all widget contracts mapped, with fallback/disable
  support).

- Team/collaboration mesh backend endpoints.

- Localization/cultural config adapters.

- Global migration registry and auto-update system.

- CI/CD contract validator and migration overlay handler.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All overlay and rationale logs stored and encrypted per organization
  policy.

- Full GDPR, sectoral, and soft coercion audit—user can export
  action/rationale history.

- Data minimization: only essential, contractually-required event and
  rationale logs retained.

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for \>10,000 concurrent widget sessions, \<1s latency target.

- Widgets are independently loadable (micro-frontends/pods).

- Support phased or dynamic disabling on contract drift, preventing user
  error.

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring culture- and sector-specific overlays are always accurate and
  up to date.

- Preventing notification fatigue while maintaining compliance
  requirements.

- Managing version migrations in daily regulated environments without
  user frustration.

- Guaranteeing rapid recovery from offline/contract drift states.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium: 3–4 weeks for robust MVP (core sandwich, overlays, adapters,
  event logging, migration).

- Critical overlays (legal, fatigue, culture) in first two weeks,
  advanced panels after MVP.
