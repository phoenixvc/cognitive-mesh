# Cognitive Mesh v3 Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Philosophically & Legally Sharpened)

> **Note:** For the system-level/visionary PRD, see [cognitive-mesh-v3.nextgen-architecture.md](./cognitive-mesh-v3.nextgen-architecture.md)

### TL;DR

The Cognitive Mesh v3 backend delivers a globally compliant, culturally adaptive, and philosophically rigorous multi-agent architecture. With configurable Cognitive Sandwich phases, advanced sovereignty and fluency, real-time legal and ethical assurance, and mitigation for productivity and fatigue, it supports organizations seeking auditable, human-centric, and research-ready AI deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Accelerate secure and ethical AI deployment for enterprises across regions and sectors.
- Achieve end-to-end legal and cultural compliance (GDPR, sectoral, global) by default.
- Lead the market in auditable human agency, trust, and transparency for autonomous systems.
- Enable empirical research and global regulatory readiness in operational AI environments.

### User Goals

- Empower users to confidently drive decisions with transparent, human-AI collaboration.
- Ensure sovereignty, clear authorship, and "right to explanation" throughout all interactions.
- Adapt user experience to culture, sector, and context.
- Deliver predictable, uninterrupted workflows without notification fatigue.

### Non-Goals

- No direct implementation of UI or client-side interfaces (handled in frontend).
- Not responsible for bespoke integrations outside documented API contracts.
- No proprietary lock-in to a particular cloud—Azure native but extensible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Enterprise Knowledge Worker (Analyst, Strategist)**

- As a knowledge worker, I want to see which phase of the process I'm in and step back when needed, so that I maintain control and authorship over the work.
- As a decision-maker, I want to verify that AI suggestions are explainable, traceable, and respect my sector's compliance needs, so that I can defend decisions to regulators and peers.
- As a global team member, I want the system to match local cultural norms in prompts and authority, so that adoption and collaboration feel natural.

**Persona: IT Compliance Officer**

- As a compliance officer, I want all choices, consent actions, and overrides to be logged with cultural/legal rationale, so that audits are easy and risk is minimized.
- As an auditor, I want self-serve access to regulatory and philosophical compliance reports for every workflow.

**Persona: Research Lead / Product Owner**

- As a research lead, I want engagement/fatigue/sovereignty data and feedback loops embedded in the platform, so that pilot studies and continuous improvement are supported.
- As a product owner, I want to adapt the phase workflow (add/remove steps, set pre/postconditions) quickly without redeployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Cognitive Sandwich / Workflow Engines (Priority: Must)**

  - Configurable N-phase process (3–7), with pre/postconditions and feedback/step-back support.
  - Individual phases (e.g., Human Analysis, AI Processing, Human Validation) as modular API endpoints and adapters.
  - SandwichOrchestrator and CognitiveSovereigntyBridge connect individual, team, and enterprise level logic.

- **Philosophical & Ethical Engines (Priority: Must)**

  - NormativeAgencyEngine (Brandom): Ensures reasoning traceability, discursive integrity, and epistemic control in all agent/human cycles.
  - InformationEthicsEngine (Floridi): Protects informational dignity, reversibility, and user control, with audits at each output stage.

- **Fluency & Sovereignty Layer (Priority: Must)**

  - FluencySovereigntyModel, TransitionManager, CognitiveLoadMonitor:
    - All phase and mode transitions routed through cognitive load/self-regulation logic.
    - Dynamic fluency/sovereignty balancing, real-time recommendations.

- **Legal/Compliance Adaptors (Priority: Must)**

  - SoftCoercionFramework (Bundeskartellamt): Digital nudges, reversibility, and consent/choice audits for European and German law.
  - SectoralRegulationsFramework: Healthcare, finance, and GDPR overlays; per-sector compliance APIs.

- **CIA Framework (Complete 5-Stage) (Priority: Must)**

  - Scoping: Stakeholder/AI mapping, touchpoint workshops
  - Assessment: Audit logs, survey, and event capture
  - Mitigation: UI controls, mode toggles, reflection points
  - Monitoring: Telemetry and real-time/aggregate metric calculation
  - Reporting: Dashboarding, trend score aggregation, alerts

- **Mitigation Engines (Priority: Must)**

  - NotificationFatigueMitigation: Adaptive engagement and custom notification batching logic per user/task.
  - ProductivityImpactMitigation: Dashboard-driven reflection and workflow optimization.

- **Cross-Cultural Adaptation Layer (Priority: Must)**

  - CrossCulturalFramework (Hofstede, etc.): Prompts, phase transitions, overrides, and consent messaging localized per user/team context.

- **Audit Logging & Research Hooks (Priority: Must)**

  - Logging at every phase/action/transition (user, phase, agent, CSI, cultural/legal context, reason).
  - Integrated feedback/step-back hooks and rationales for research and regulatory review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users connect via authenticated API client; onboarding steps confirm region, culture, and compliance context.
- Documentation provided with sample workflows and phase configuration templates.

**Core Experience**

- Step 1: User or agent interfaces with endpoint for phase N (e.g., initiate "Human Analysis").

  - System checks for preconditions and context (culture, sector, phase config).
  - Returns next steps, highlighting authorship/sovereignty, with audit ID for traceability.

- Step 2: During phase execution, transitions are dynamically routed via the FluencySovereignty and Legal engines.

  - Adaptive mode (manual/hybrid/auto) suggested; override logged.
  - All outputs checked for discursive integrity and informational dignity.

- Step 3: On completion or error, backend validates postconditions and either allows transition, blocks, or suggests step-back.

  - Users/agencies can invoke feedback/rewind with rationale—system rolls back state, updates audit.

- Step 4: At each phase, CSI/CIA/mitigation logic determines engagement, fatigue risk, and cross-cultural alignment.

- Step 5: System continuously exposes real-time compliance reports, engagement metrics, and status/trend dashboards for researchers and compliance officers.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Dynamic phase addition/removal and real-time config updates.
- Forced legal/compliance override or "manual review" on policy triggers.
- Multi-agent orchestration and conflict-resolution logic.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Every decision, prompt, and transition provides audit/tracing hooks.
- Accessibility, notification/minimal fatigue and culture-specific overlays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

Vanessa, an EU-based risk analyst at a multinational biotech firm, tackles high-stakes investment scenarios using the Cognitive Mesh platform. As she scopes a complex project, the system walks her through a transparent, configurable phase workflow: Human Analysis, AI Pattern Recognition, and Structured Human Validation. Each suggestion—no matter how fluently generated—triggers audit trails, cultural adaptation of prompts, and legal compliance checks for GDPR and sector-specific regulations. If Vanessa ever feels rushed or overwhelmed, she can initiate a step-back, see notification batch summaries, and review every rationale in clear text. Behind the scenes, the NormativeAgency and InformationEthics modules ensure true discursive integrity and epistemic control. By project's end, Vanessa confidently presents an auditable report—her reasoning, AI's contributions, cultural and legal framing—in a format trusted by colleagues and external regulators. Her firm's leadership recognizes not just the insight, but the rigorous, human-centered process behind every critical decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Centralized registry for dynamic phase/config management, contracts enforcement, and migration.

### Integration Points

- Azure cloud native, but RESTful contracts for extendibility.
- Integration-ready with upstream auth, org HR, regulatory reporting.
- Outbound hooks/APIs for frontend widgets and research dashboards.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Secure, resilient audit log; regional data residency compliance.
- All sensitive prompts, consent choices, and cognitive assessments encrypted in transit and at rest.
- No user data retained beyond necessary compliance or user directive—clear retention and deletion interfaces.

### Scalability & Performance

- Horizontal scalability by phase/adapter; adaptive caching for AI-intensive phases.
- System must handle global user base and multi-enterprise deployments.
- Batch and streaming telemetry support for real-time dashboards.

### Potential Challenges

- Harmonizing legal requirements across conflicting sector/region boundaries.
- Balancing exhaustive auditing versus user productivity and notification fatigue.
- Ensuring fail-safe prompt/decision handoff in multi-agent and team scenarios.
