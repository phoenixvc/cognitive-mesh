# Proactive Disruption Intelligence PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

Build an anticipatory disruption and risk engine to proactively detect, assess, and respond to external AI-driven threats and competitive pressures. Leverages LangChain agents for scanning and competitive analysis, calibrates risk scoring with Ray RLlib, tracks and iterates models using Weights & Biases, and supports local LLMs for confidential or sovereign data needs. All core elements run in Azure AKS via Helm/Bicep; dashboards, widgets, and APIs consume and visualize the data.
