# Mesh-Level Orchestration & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration PRD

### TL;DR

A robust Kubernetes-based orchestration layer for the Cognitive Mesh coordinates all Exponential Ideaflow engines—generation, filtering, creativity, taste, recursive improvement—to ensure every workflow flows through both AI and human-in-the-loop stages. The orchestrator enforces real-time oversight, guarantees auditability, and logs every event and checkpoint. All mesh operations are observable, permissioned, and integrated with RBAC, security, and enterprise compliance.
