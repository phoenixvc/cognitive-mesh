# Self-Disruption Mesh Infrastructure PRD (Azure/Kubernetes/Bicep)

## TL;DR

This document defines a secure, repeatable, and autoscaling Azure infrastructure underpinning the Self-Disruption AI Mesh of six metacognitive engines. Helm charts and Bicep templates deliver reproducible infrastructure-as-code. All secrets are isolated in Azure Key Vault. Helm manages Kubernetes (AKS) deployments. Bicep is chosen over Terraform and Pulumi as the infra-as-code backbone for Azure-native environments.
