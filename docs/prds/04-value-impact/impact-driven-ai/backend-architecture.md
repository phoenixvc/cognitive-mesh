# Impact-Driven AI Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Layered)

### TL;DR

This Impact-Driven AI backend architecture is decomposed across the
mesh’s layered model using a hexagonal (ports-and-adapters) approach.
Each mesh layer embodies a focused core: FoundationLayer
(event/provenance logging), ReasoningLayer (scoring, passion/culture
inference), MetacognitiveLayer (safety/culture analytics), AgencyLayer
(multi-agent orchestration), and BusinessApplications (API/consent
shell). Every layer exposes clear domain ports and is integrated by
standardized adapters (API, DB, eventbus, observability), ensuring
robust, observable, and testable mesh-wide orchestration.

## 1. Hexagonal Architecture & Mesh Layer Map (+ Diagram)

**Layered Hexagonal Overview**

- **FoundationLayer**: Handles event capture and provenance
  logging—tenant-scoped, secure, fully auditable.

- **ReasoningLayer**: Hosts all pure inference/ML—impact scoring,
  virality, passion/culture modeling, humanity enrichment.

- **MetacognitiveLayer**: Aggregates and analyzes psychological safety
  and culture health at aggregate/team/temporal levels.

- **AgencyLayer**: Multi-agent orchestration, “nudge bots,” automated
  execution engines.

- **BusinessApplications**: External APIs (REST/gRPC), consent/approval
  logic, workflow orchestration, widget/event push.

**Hexagonal Model**

- **Core**: Each layer has its own pure domain engines, uncoupled from
  the outside world.

- **Ports**: Well-specified interfaces for external access (e.g.
  scoring, consent, notifications).

- **Adapters**: For protocols (REST, gRPC, CLI), storage, observability,
  and eventbus integration.

## 2. Domain Cores: Layered Logic

**Mapped Engines and Mesh Layers**

- **FoundationLayer**

  - *EventCaptureEngine*: Accepts all workflow/interaction events.

  - *ProvenanceLogger*: Anchors every change with tenant/biz/consent
    info.

- **ReasoningLayer**

  - *ImpactFirstMeasurementEngine*: Scores impact, virality, workflow
    depth.

  - *PassionDrivenAIOrchestrator*: LLM/ML-driven community matchmaking.

  - *HumanityFirstEnrichmentEngine*: Personalizes and tags outputs.

- **MetacognitiveLayer**

  - *PsychologicalSafetyCultureEngine*: Aggregates health/risk, surfaces
    signals.

- **AgencyLayer**

  - *MultiAgentCollabOrchestrator*: Orchestrates multi-agent tasks and
    agent-to-agent messaging.

**Domain logic per engine remains *pure*, tested headless and isolated
from outside protocols. Integration is achieved *only* via ports and
adapters.**

## 4. Adapters: Inbound & Outbound (+ Error Handling, Fallbacks)

- **Inbound Adapters**

  - REST/gRPC Adapters: OpenAPI-synced, accessible via mesh/gateway,
    performs input validation, retries once (w/backoff) on transient
    error, circuit-breaker on 3x retry fail.

  - CLI/Eventbus: For scheduled or bulk ingest scenarios, also used for
    internal mesh service automation.

- **Outbound Adapters**

  - DB/Repository Adapter: Ensures atomic persistent write, retry on
    timeout, fallback to append-only queue if relational/database
    downstream is down (alert triggers after 5 mins).

  - Notification/Event Adapter: Triggers widgets, agents, or downstream
    integrators. Retries 3x with exponential backoff, fails to queued
    fallback and posts error to observability channel.

  - Observability/Telemetry Adapter: Pushes latency, error, event
    metadata to mesh metrics system; emits traces for any call > SLA by
    >10%.

- **Error Handling Highlights**

  - Every adapter defines its retry, timeout, and error-path logic per
    port.

  - Every user/action returns clear error states up the stack (with
    provenance and consent meta).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Data Contracts, Provenance & Consent

- **Data Contracts**

  - All public-facing APIs versioned and described in a living OpenAPI
    spec.

  - Contracts cover every request/response (event, score, consent) and
    include required/optional schema fields.

- **Provenance & Consent**

  - Provenance: Every data mutation, scoring, or orchestration logs
    origin, actor, consent, and evidence IDs.

  - Consent: All actions requiring user/legal consent must log explicit
    consent; included as meta in request and surfaced to all downstream
    layers.

- **Contract Testing**

  - Every event/adapter path verified by contract/integration test
    suite, preventing drift and silent failure.

  - Provenance trail validated at API and storage boundary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. End-to-End Layered Sequence Diagram

**Event/Workflow Step-by-Step**

1.  **Widget/User Event** initiated

2.  Hits **BusinessApplications Layer** via REST/gRPC adapter

    - Consent/approval checked (ConsentPort/ApprovalPort)

    - API input validated (OpenAPI)

3.  Event passed through **FoundationLayer**

    - CapturePort ingests, ProvenanceLogger writes audit/tenant/consent
      record

4.  Routed to **ReasoningLayer**

    - ImpactScoringPort processes, ML/LLM model invoked, returns score

    - PassionMatch/HumanityEnrichment as needed, all outputs tagged with
      provenance

5.  Flows to **MetacognitiveLayer**

    - SafetyMetricsPort aggregates, updates team/org health and trends,
      emits risk signal if triggered

6.  Invokes **AgencyLayer**

    - MultiAgentOrchestrationPort decides: trigger agent/AI action,
      escalate/notify

7.  **Outbound Adapters**:

    - Notification sent to widgets, agents, or dashboards (via
      NotificationAdapter)

    - Observability metrics and provenance trail pushed to
      tracing/logging infra

8.  **Widget/UI** receives update, user receives feedback/alert/score

**Latency/Boundary Touchpoints**

- Consent verified on entry

- <100ms logging/provenance (Foundation)

- <200ms scoring (Reasoning)

- Real-time aggregates (Metacognitive)

- Immediate notification or queued fallback (Agency/BusinessApp)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements: Layered + Global

- **Global Inheritance:**

  - All layers inherit baseline NFRs: security, authentication, privacy,
    audit, data sovereignty.

  - Observability/metrics/trace required for every port/adaptor
    boundary.

- **Layer-Specific Additions:**

  - Foundation/Reasoning strict SLAs (<100ms log, <200ms scoring).

  - Metacognitive proactive escalation on risk/trend spike.

  - Every critical call emits traces; calls >10% slower than SLA
    flagged to alerting system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Caching, Recovery, Versioning & State

- **Caching**

  - Scoring/metrics results may be cached by Reasoning/Metacognitive for
    hot queries (TTL default 10min, invalidated by event or user
    override).

  - Consent/approval state cached short-lived (max 1hr) for user/session
    flows.

  - Agent workflow results cached per agent config; long-term persisted.

- **Recovery**

  - All failed adapter calls (DB, events, notification) stored to
    retry-queue (FIFO, max 24h retry window).

  - Hot/cold cluster restart acceptance: must resume without data loss,
    orphaned provenance, or missed notifications.

- **Versioning**

  - Major/minor versioning on each API (semver), contract compatibility
    tests at release.

  - Contract drift is a CI-blocker; every breaking change flagged and
    must have an explicit migration/compatibility path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Risks, Testing, and Mitigations

- **Risks**

  - Port/API drift between Reasoning and BusinessApp layers

  - Adapter-level bottlenecks (e.g., if event notification spikes,
    queue/rate-limits may drop SLA)

  - Consent not propagating to all downstream audit logs

  - Provenance failures or non-auditable event paths

- **Mitigations**

  - Mandatory contract and integration test harness spanning all
    layer/port/adaptor combos

  - Synthetic user flow monitoring from widget to consent to scoring to
    notification

  - Fast failover for adapter bottlenecks, with fallback/alerting for
    persistent errors

  - Recovery and replay logic: all orphaned events/data reprocessed on
    recovery

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Milestones & Cross-Mesh Evolution

- **MVP (Weeks 1–3, Small Team: 2–3 individuals)**

  - FoundationLayer and ReasoningLayer deployed with complete ingress,
    logging, scoring, and provenance flows.

  - Consent/approval adapters functional; contract and integration tests
    green.

  - Widget(s) connect to API; end-to-end data flow/observability signed
    off by product and engineering.

- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4–6)**

  - Integrate Metacognitive and Agency layers

  - Event fan-out for (risk) trend escalation and agent orchestration

  - Mesh-wide SLA monitoring and dashboard integration

  - Enhanced fallback, bulk event ingestion, and multi-agent testing

- **Continuous**

  - API/contract evolution and backward compatibility checks

  - Expansion of coverage to new mesh widgets, plug-in agents, and
    sector-specific apps

  - SLA compliance, privacy audits, full provenance validation per
    release
