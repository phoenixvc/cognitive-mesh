# Impact-Driven AI Mesh Widget PRD

### TL;DR

Mesh widgets deliver real-time impact metrics, passion signals, safety
scores, and humanity amplification controls directly within the
Cognitive Mesh dashboard. Each widget operates as a configurable,
API-powered plugin, providing personalized, actionable insights to users
and teams. The goal: transform dashboards from passive data panels to
dynamic drivers of impact, belonging, and trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Shift organizational measurement from activity tracking to actual
  impact and culture outcomes.

- Drive adoption of cognitive mesh by empowering every user with
  precise, relevant feedback about their value and contributions.

- Increase retention and engagement by surfacing passion, humanity, and
  psychological safety directly in the user experience.

- Position the mesh as the enterprise standard for transparency, user
  agency, and data-driven transformation.

### User Goals

- Help users and teams see the real impact of their work, not just
  system activity.

- Amplify individual uniqueness and foster passion-aligned
  collaboration.

- Provide safe, trustworthy environments through transparent
  safety/sentiment signals.

- Deliver actionable insights, provenance, and feedback in a way that
  builds agency and trust.

### Non-Goals

- Building backend orchestration logic or data ingestion pipelines
  (handled by backend services).

- Creating generic reporting tools or dashboards disconnected from the
  mesh platform’s identity.

- Supporting non-configurable, one-size-fits-all widget experiences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Personas:**

- Team Leader (Sandra)

- Individual Contributor (Liam)

- Facilitator/Coach (Maria)

- Creative/AI Collaborator (Riya)

- Platform Admin (Jordan)

**User Stories:**

- As a **Team Leader**, I want an “Impact Dashboard” widget so that I
  can quickly identify and celebrate high-value contributions in my
  team.

- As an **Individual Contributor**, I want a “Passion Discovery” widget
  so that I can see opportunities and workstreams that align with what
  excites me.

- As a **Facilitator/Coach**, I want a “Safety Pulse” widget so that I
  can monitor team sentiment and quickly intervene where psychological
  safety drops.

- As a **Creative/AI Collaborator**, I want an “Amplify Humanity”
  control to ensure my unique perspective and context shape AI-driven
  outputs.

- As a **Platform Admin**, I want easy setup and insight surfacing
  controls, so I can configure cross-team dashboards and permissions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Impact Dashboard Widget** (Priority: Must)

  - Visualizes organizational impact/success metrics by team,
    individual, initiative, and time period.

  - Offers drill-down and filter capabilities (e.g., by department,
    timeframe).

  - Accepts personalized prompts or perspectives.

  - Given a configured dashboard, when a user returns, the state and
    filters persist 100% of the time.

- **Passion Discovery Widget** (Priority: Must)

  - Surfaces opportunities, projects, or communities aligned to the
    user's detected or declared passions.

  - Provides onboarding (profile parsing, quick-tagging) for users to
    refine their passion signal.

  - “Given my passion selection, when I confirm or update it, then
    recommendations refresh immediately and persist for repeat visits.”

- **Safety Pulse Widget** (Priority: Must)

  - Displays rolling sentiment/safety metrics relevant to the user’s
    team or group.

  - Sends proactive alerts when risk/safety thresholds are crossed.

  - “Given a recorded risk event, when the threshold is exceeded, then a
    banner and actionable next-step are surfaced within 30 seconds.”

- **Humanity Amplifier Control** (Priority: Should)

  - Lets users add their unique story/context into AI outputs or mesh
    recommendations.

  - Provides UI for “Amplify My Voice” within existing widgets.

- **Multi-Agent Controls** (Priority: Should)

  - Allow advanced users to choose and orchestrate between different
    AI/creative agents for better co-creation.

  - Surfacing agent options clearly, with provenance cues.

- **Widget Pinning & Custom Combos** (Priority: Should)

  - Users can pin favorite widgets, compose custom dashboards, and save
    configurations.

  - “Given pinned widgets, when the dashboard is reloaded, then the
    arrangement is preserved without error.”

- **Admin Setup Panel & Cross-Team Insights** (Priority: Could)

  - Enables admins to configure organization-wide defaults, cross-group
    dashboards, and data access/visibility rules.

  - “Given admin rights, when a new widget is published, then I can
    assign it to selected user groups within the console.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## API Contract Reference & Visuals

### Shared API Contract

All widgets consume APIs from the mesh backend. API contract and schema
are defined in the shared OpenAPI spec (\[link or internal reference\]).
All schema or interface revisions must be jointly reviewed by both
widget and backend leads.

### Visual Sequence Diagram (Click-to-Result Flow)

1.  **User action:** User clicks on widget (e.g., update passion).

2.  **Widget call:** Widget issues API call (e.g.,
    /v1/orchestrator/passions) with context.

3.  **Backend pipeline:** Backend processes, calculates new
    matches/metrics, logs provenance.

4.  **Provenance event:** Audit event logged and sent back as part of
    response.

5.  **Widget UI update:** Widget renders new insights or error/success
    banner.

6.  **User approval/consent:** If action affects personal/team data,
    explicit consent dialog is shown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience, Flows & Diagrams

### Entry Point & Onboarding

- First-time users see a lightweight, step-by-step onboarding:

  - Brief explainer/tutorial overlay.

  - Select passions/interests in Passion Discovery.

  - Consent dialog outlining metrics and safety signals.

### Core Experience

- Core dashboard displays default widgets (Impact, Passion, Safety
  Pulse).

  - Users can drag/drop, customize, or hide widgets.

  - Clicking on a widget tile expands details (drill-down, filter,
    contribution highlights).

  - Consent/provenance overlays appear as needed (e.g., when sharing
    data/team signals).

  - Errors and offline events surface banners or fallbacks, never
    ambiguous states.

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Power-users can pin/rearrange widgets and save layouts per
  device/account.

- Offline states: If backend is unreachable, last-good data shown with
  “stale” warnings and retry.

- Error states: API failures surface clear error banners,
  troubleshooting info, and recovery actions.

- Agent stall: If a multi-agent workflow is unresponsive, widget times
  out and offers the user a safe fallback.

### UI/UX Highlights

- Responsive, modular tile/grid layout; widgets resizable.

- Color/contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA and all text resizes gracefully.

- All onboarding/consent steps are skippable or reviewable later.

- Tooltips, info icons, and expandable provenance details on relevant
  elements.

## Narrative

Sandra is a team leader rolling out a global initiative on the Cognitive
Mesh. Instead of tracking “activity,” she wants to surface real, lasting
impact, foster psychological safety, and unleash her team’s potential.
On logging in, she’s greeted by a dashboard showing the tangible results
of her team’s collaborations, a “Safety Pulse” flashing green (all is
well), and passion discovery nudges toward growth projects. Liam, an
individual contributor, uses the “Amplify Humanity” control to ensure
his expertise shapes AI-suggested solutions. Maria, the facilitator,
receives instant alerts when her team’s safety signals dip, letting her
act before tension rises. Even when the network glitches, the Mesh
widgets surface the latest good metrics—transparent about what’s current
and what’s cached. Every interaction builds trust, belonging, and
clarity. Over the next quarter, engagement rises and Sandra’s team
becomes a company leader in innovation and well-being.
