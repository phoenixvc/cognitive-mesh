# Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Foundational)

### TL;DR

This document establishes the foundational Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework for the entire Cognitive Mesh platform. It translates philosophical principles (Brandom's normative agency, Floridi's information ethics) and global legal mandates (GDPR, EU AI Act, sectoral rules) into a concrete, distributed architecture. This framework is implemented across the existing mesh layers via new engines and adapters, ensuring that all agentic and human-AI interactions are auditable, transparent, culturally adaptive, and compliant by design. All other PRDs must reference and adhere to this foundational specification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- **Achieve Global Compliance by Default:** Ensure all platform operations meet or exceed major international regulatory standards (GDPR, EU AI Act) and key sectoral rules (finance, healthcare).
- **Minimize Enterprise Risk:** Drastically reduce legal, reputational, and operational risk associated with autonomous AI systems through proactive compliance and auditable governance.
- **Lead in Trustworthy AI:** Establish the Cognitive Mesh as the market leader in transparent, ethical, and human-centric AI collaboration, making it the default choice for regulated industries.
- **Enable Empirical Research:** Provide a research-ready infrastructure with high-fidelity audit trails to support continuous improvement and academic collaboration.

### User Goals

- **Empower with Transparency:** Provide users with a clear understanding of the "why" behind AI actions through traceable reasoning and explainable decisions.
- **Preserve Human Dignity:** Ensure all AI interactions respect user agency and informational dignity, with clear authorship and the ability to correct or rewind processes.
- **Deliver Culturally-Aware Experiences:** Adapt UI prompts, consent flows, and authority models to align with users' local cultural norms and expectations.
- **Guarantee Compliance:** Give users confidence that their interactions are protected and compliant with the highest legal and ethical standards.

### Non-Goals

- This PRD does not define the UI for surfacing compliance data (covered in widget PRDs).
- It does not replace the need for dedicated legal counsel; it provides the technical framework to enforce legal requirements.
- It is not a standalone product but a foundational, cross-cutting concern integrated into the existing mesh architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Compliance Officer (Irfan)**

- As a Compliance Officer, I want every agentic decision to be logged with its full reasoning chain and legal justification, so that I can produce audit-ready reports in minutes, not weeks.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to configure and enforce regional data residency and processing rules (e.g., GDPR), so that the platform is compliant by default in every jurisdiction.

**Persona: Knowledge Worker (Vanessa)**

- As a Knowledge Worker in Germany, I want the system's nudges and suggestions to be presented as clear choices, not manipulative defaults, so my cognitive sovereignty is respected according to local law.
- As a Knowledge Worker, I want to understand why a certain AI suggestion was made (provenance) and be ableto correct it, so I can trust the system as a collaborator, not an opaque black box.

**Persona: Enterprise Architect (Priya)**

- As an Enterprise Architect, I want a modular, extensible framework for adding new sectoral compliance rules without re-architecting the core system.
- As an Enterprise Architect, I want to see that all data flows adhere to the principle of informational dignity, with clear user control and reversibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

### Philosophical & Ethical Engines (Priority: Must)

- **NormativeAgencyEngine (Brandom):** A pure domain engine in the ReasoningLayer that ensures all agent and human interactions produce structured, traceable reasoning chains. Every output must be justifiable within a normative framework.
- **InformationEthicsEngine (Floridi):** A pure domain engine in the ReasoningLayer that enforces principles of informational dignity. It validates that all AI-generated outputs are presented transparently, are reversible, and respect the user as an informational subject.

### Legal/Compliance Adapters (Priority: Must)

- **GDPRComplianceAdapter:** A BusinessApplications adapter that enforces GDPR principles, including the "right to explanation," data portability, and consent management for personal data.
- **EUAIActComplianceAdapter:** A BusinessApplications adapter that classifies AI systems by risk level, enforces cognitive risk assessments for high-risk use cases, and ensures transparency obligations are met.
- **SectoralRegulationsFramework:** A pluggable framework in BusinessApplications for adding compliance modules for specific industries (e.g., finance - MiFID II, healthcare - 21st Century Cures Act).
- **SoftCoercionFramework (Bundeskartellamt):** A BusinessApplications adapter that audits all UI "nudges" and choice architectures to ensure they are not manipulative and comply with German/EU consumer protection laws.

### Cross-Cultural Adaptation Layer (Priority: Must)

- **CrossCulturalFramework (Hofstede):** A MetacognitiveLayer service that adapts UI prompts, consent flows, and authority displays based on configured cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism, power distance).

### Audit & Governance Infrastructure (Priority: Must)

- **ComprehensiveAuditLogging:** The FoundationLayer's `AuditLoggingAdapter` must be extended to log all ethical/legal events with full context (user, policy, rationale, cultural context, legal framework version).
- **ComplianceReportingEngine:** A BusinessApplications service that allows admins and compliance officers to generate self-serve reports for specific regulations, timeframes, and users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advanced Governance & Policy Management

Ensuring *continuous* compliance requires more than static adapters – it
demands an adaptive governance layer that can author, approve, enforce,
measure, and rollback policies in real-time.

### 1. Policy Lifecycle Management
* **Versioned Policies:** Every policy (legal, ethical, cultural) is
  stored with semantic versioning and change-log metadata in the
  `PolicyRepository`.
* **Approval Workflows:** Draft → Review → Approved → Deprecated.
  Multi-stakeholder e-signatures captured and audit-logged.
* **Instant Rollback:** Any approved policy can be rolled back to a
  previous version; affected services receive event-driven updates.

### 2. Business Process Governance
* **Non-Technical Workflows:** Support human approval chains for
  high-impact changes (e.g., enabling a new high-risk agent).
* **Stakeholder Mapping:** Role-based routing (Legal, Security,
  Data-Privacy) with SLA timers and escalation paths.

### 3. Dynamic Policy Enforcement
* **Real-Time Evaluation:** `AIGovernanceMonitor` evaluates active
  policies on every significant event (phase transition, agent action).
* **Policy-as-Code:** Author policies in Rego/OPA or YAML rules that are
  hot-reloaded without downtime.

### 4. Governance Analytics & Reporting
* **Effectiveness Metrics:** Track policy violations prevented,
  approvals SLA, rollback frequency.
* **Trend Dashboards:** Part of `ComplianceReportingEngine`, exposing
  month-over-month compliance posture and cultural adaptation success.

### 5. Stakeholder Workflow Management
* **Delegation Patterns:** Temporary delegation and proxy approvals with
  expiry dates.
* **Multi-Level Approvals:** Configurable n-level chains with parallel
  or sequential modes.
