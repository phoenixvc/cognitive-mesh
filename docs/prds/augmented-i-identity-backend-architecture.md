# Augmented-I Identity Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Sharpened)

### TL;DR

Backend for identity and mindset augmentation in Cognitive Mesh, transforming professionals from “AI tool users” to “Augmented-I” humans. All business logic, API contracts, error envelopes, and consent flows are universally testable with Given/When/Then acceptance, directly mapped to Foundation, Reasoning, BusinessApps, and Agency layers. Includes exact OpenAPI fragments, diagram library, test harness, explicit governance, CI, and managed deprecation/change cycles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Deliver a robust, composable system for identity transformation, from “uses AI” to “is augmented by AI.”
- Accelerate professional adoption and value creation through measurable mindset and behavioral shift.
- Drive organizational competitiveness by embedding augmentation, bias detection, and anti-recklessness at every knowledge worker level.
- Ensure all data flows, consent, and review are governance- and audit-ready for HR and compliance teams.

### User Goals

- Users evolve their professional identity and operate from a default of “Augmented-I” (not just “uses AI tools”).
- Individuals and orgs receive real-time feedback/coaching on augmentation journey and reckless non-adoption.
- Consent, privacy, and review controls are transparent and accessible to every user.
- Users clearly see their F-Scale (Fear → Fun) stage and receive next-action coaching within their workflow.

### Non-Goals

- Does not provide user-facing widget/frontend code (see separate PRD).
- Not designed for consumer/gaming or non-professional chat applications.
- Does not replace corporate HR compliance platforms—integrates/gates as needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona 1: Knowledge Worker**

- As a knowledge worker, I want to see my current augmentation/F-Scale status, so that I know how “Augmented-I” I am becoming.
- As a knowledge worker, I want prompts and nudges that accelerate my move from fear/familiarity to fluency/fun, so that I’m increasingly competitive and confident.
- As a knowledge worker, I want to understand where I’m being “reckless” in not using augmentation, so I can improve.
- As a knowledge worker, I want all my data, augmentation assessments, and HR flags to be transparent and manually reviewable.

**Persona 2: HR/Org Reviewer**

- As an HR reviewer, I want to review flagged cases of reckless non-augmentation, so that only fair and bias-checked actions are taken.
- As an HR reviewer, I want auditable logs of all augmentation, consent, and review actions, so that we remain in compliance.

**Persona 3: Chief Augmentation Officer**

- As a Chief Augmentation Officer, I want organization-wide dashboards of augmentation bias/distribution, so I can create action plans.
- As a Chief Augmentation Officer, I want to assign, gate, and review “augmentation milestones” and reflex adoption rates per team or user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

### Core Mesh Features (All Priority: Must unless stated)

- **IdentityIntegrationPort (REST/gRPC)**

  - Returns: user’s full augmentation/F-Scale/Journey/bias status
  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11identity-integration~1post`
  - Given a valid profile, when requested, then respond in <200ms with augmented status (cf. schema) and bias metric
  - On malformed: respond 400/error; log correlationID
  - G/W/T for both normal/edge/bad-payload/circuit open

- **MindsetEmbeddingPort (REST/gRPC)**

  - Returns: current F-Scale (Fear/Familiar/Fluent/Fun), next-target reflex or mindset question, recent bias evolution
  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11mindset-embedding~1post`
  - Given current journey usage pattern, when queried, then provide F-Scale and coaching message (in <250ms)
  - Edge: Stuck state (never progresses past Familiar), must prompt for intervention
  - Offline: cache last skill level; “retry” triggers fresh fetch.

- **NonAugmentationDetectionPort**

  - Returns: reckless status (boolean), non-augmentation bias (float 0–1), and rationale
  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11reckless-detection~1post`
  - Given workflow/task, when analyzed, then return bias metric [0–1], flag if under policy threshold, respond in <150ms.
  - Acceptance: Edge case (refuses to shift from 0); must flag for review.

- **ChiefAugmentationFrameworkPort**

  - Returns: org bias distribution, CAO role status, competitive benchmarks
  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11chief-augmentation~1post`
  - Non-critical (Should): Given org context, return latest CAO metrics; on HR flag or schema drift, lock and prompt manual review.

- **ConsentPort / ManualReviewPort / HRReviewPort**

  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/paths/1v11manual-review~1post`
  - All critical org/HR-affecting events must be gated by a consent check, with explicit audit and admin unlock for flagged cases.
  - G/W/T: On consent denied, no change written; event flagged and visible in API & logs.

- **NotificationAdapter (Event, Webhook)**

  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/NotificationEvent`
  - Must: Given identity, mindset, or augmentation event, when processed, then notify subscribed listeners in <1s and log correlationID.
  - Circuit-break: fallback to queuing if >3 failures in 1m; log; reset on 2 healthy cycles.

- **AuditLoggingAdapter**

  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AuditLogEntry`
  - Must: Given any change/event/review, when received, then record within 2s (with user ID, schema ID, correlationID).
  - Error: On DB fail, queue to batch; retry 3x with exp. backoff+jitter.

- **EventAdapter (gRPC, etc.)**

  - OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/augmented-identity.yaml#/components/schemas/AugmentationEvent`
  - Must: Same G/W/T logic; all events timestamped, provenance signed, and retriable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

- Users provisioned with default “neutral” augmentation identity and F-Scale stage “Familiar.”
- On first API call, journey onboarding: system explains the “Augmented-I” concept and F-Scale. Admins receive a setup onboarding guide.

### Core Experience

- Step 1: User/Org connects system; syncs with IdentityIntegrationPort and receives current augmentation/self status.
- Step 2: Regular background analysis via MindsetEmbeddingPort and NonAugmentationDetectionPort detects journey progression and bias evolution.
- Step 3: On notable event (reckless detected, F-Scale jump), NotificationAdapter pushes update to user(s) and logs for review.
- Step 4: Any HR-critical event triggers ConsentPort, escalates to HRReviewPort/ManualReviewPort if needed; no org/bias change until admin signoff.
- Step 5: AuditLoggingAdapter records all status changes, feedback, and unlocks.

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Consent denied: user receives automated and human escalation; system “locks” further recommendations/changes until resolved.
- Edge: Biased stuck at 0 or 1 (total non-aug or only-AI); prompts for review/intervention.
- Schema drift: If API mismatch, system disables API for affected client/service and instructs on upgrade.

### UI/UX Highlights

- All API surfaces and responses must carry traceable correlationID.
- All actions and recommendations are time-stamped, reason-stated, and logged for audit purposes.
- Error messages and “locked” states are human-readable and actionable for both users and admins.
- WCAG accessibility and i18n ready for any surfaced error messages through widget.

## Narrative

A seasoned analyst at a leading tech firm finds herself at a crossroads: her competition is increasingly augmented by AI, and her old methods lag in both speed and insight. Instead of adding yet another tool, her company rolls out Augmented-I—a backend framework built into their core systems. She logs in for the first time and sees a personalized journey map, nudges that recognize when she’s merely “using AI as a tool,” and prompts that help her habitually ask, “How can Augmented-I do this better?” Over the next weeks, her professional identity and skills evolve measurably—she’s not just using augmentation, she is augmented. HR and management see this shift ripple across teams, with governance, audit, and manual review always in place. The company pulls ahead of competitors with an adaptable, future-proof workforce. The outcomes: elevated employee confidence, organization-wide competitive gain, and auditable, compliant augmentation for every knowledge worker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- % users progressing at least one F-Scale stage per quarter
- % users with bias rising towards “Augmented-I” (e.g., bias > 0.75)
- % users who receive targeted nudges and respond within 48 hours
- % users who actively review/resolve “reckless” flags

### Business Metrics

- Org-level increase in workflow velocity as measured by pre/post F-Scale and bias metrics
- % reduction in HR/Compliance interventions due to system-driven audit and consent gates
- Reduction in employee churn attributable to increased augmentation

### Technical Metrics

- SLA adherence (see Service NFR)
- Successful completion of all compliance/audit log events in <2s 99.9%
- API error envelope, contract, and schema evolution pass in CI 100%
- Zero API drift (all adapters validated to CI agile contract suite before merge)

### Tracking Plan

- Identity/F-Scale progression events
- Bias metric changes/submissions
- Consent granted/denied actions and resolution times
- All manual review unlocks and schema versioned changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- API definition and contract enforcement via OpenAPI YAML
- Trusted service mesh for secure cross-layer communication (REST/gRPC/event)
- Data store for identity state, bias progress, and audit logs
- Circuit-breaker, backoff, caching, and error envelope logic per port/adapter

### Integration Points

- HRIS/Compliance for consent/review hooks
- Widget/frontend PRD for all user-surfaced actions
- Data export hooks for audit, compliance, and analytics tools

### Data Storage & Privacy

- PII and augmentation state must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- All HR/consent decisions stored with full audit trail and manual unlock only
- Regional compliance (GDPR, etc.) enforced via FoundationLayer storage config

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 10k+ simultaneous users with live augmentation state/notifications
- Multi-region failover for FoundationLayer storage and notification; SLOs enforce low-latency and full DR

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring API contracts and schemas evolve without drift/compatibility gaps
- Protecting the privacy and rights of users under aggressive augmentation/HR paradigms
- Automating manual review/consent processes without increasing burden/latency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium (2–4 weeks for MVP, core layer wiring, three key port/adapter flows plus CI harness; extension in sprints for full governance, consent, org/cao logic)

### Team Size & Composition

- Small Team: 2–3 total people (Product+Backend; optional DevOps for CI/DC)
- Phases align with lean, testable releases; each includes one person responsible for PRD delivery and milestone demo.

## Architecture Integration & Component Mapping

The functionality in this PRD extends **existing cognitive-mesh components** rather than introducing an entirely new stack. The table and notes below map new engines, ports, and adapters to the current layered hexagonal architecture, calling out *exact* files or interfaces that must be created or amended.

| Layer | New / Updated Component | Action Required | Integration Point(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ReasoningLayer** | `IdentityIntegrationEngine` (NEW)<br>`MindsetEmbeddingEngine` (NEW)<br>`RecklessNonAugmentationEngine` (NEW)<br>`ChiefAugmentationOfficerFramework` (NEW) | • Add pure-domain engines (`src/ReasoningLayer/AugmentedIdentity/Engines/`).<br>• Expose via **new ports**: `IIdentityIntegrationPort`, `IMindsetEmbeddingPort`, `INonAugmentationDetectionPort`, `IChiefAugmentationFrameworkPort`. | Consumed by BusinessApplications API adapter. |
| **BusinessApplications** | `AugmentedIdentityController` (NEW) | • Create a new controller to route to the new ports.<br>• Add OpenAPI paths: `/v1/identity-integration`, `/v1/mindset-embedding`, `/v1/reckless-detection`, `/v1/chief-augmentation`. | OpenAPI file `docs/openapi.yaml` – add/modify schemas & operations. |
| | `IConsentPort` (UPDATE) | • Extend to handle new consent types: `AugmentationAnalysis`, `RecklessDetectionMonitoring`.<br>• Ensure consent is checked before calling any HR-sensitive endpoint. | `src/BusinessApplications/ConvenerServices/Ports/IConsentPort.cs`. |
| | `IManualReviewPort` (NEW) | • Create a new port for human-in-the-loop review of flagged reckless non-augmentation cases. | Integrates with HR systems or an admin dashboard for manual review. |
| **FoundationLayer** | `AuditLoggingAdapter` (UPDATE) | • Add new event types: `AugmentationStatusUpdated`, `FScaleStageAdvanced`, `RecklessFlagged`, `ManualReviewRequested`.<br>• Ensure searchable ≤ 2s SLA. | Existing audit DB + event ingestion queue. |
| | `NotificationAdapter` (UPDATE) | • Broadcast F-Scale nudges, reckless detection alerts, and manual review requests to the appropriate channels. | Mesh event bus (`Topic: augmented-identity-events`). |
| | `DBAdapter` (UPDATE) | • Add new repositories and EF Core configurations for `AugmentedIdentity` and `FScaleJourney` entities. | `src/ConvenerLayer/Infrastructure/Persistence/ConvenerDbContext.cs` (or a new DbContext). |
