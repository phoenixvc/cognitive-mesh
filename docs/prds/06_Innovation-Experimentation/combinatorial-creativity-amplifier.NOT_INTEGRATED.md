# Combinatorial Creativity Amplifier PRD

### TL;DR

A mesh service that traverses the organizational knowledge graph at up to 6+ hops to auto-generate, score, and surface truly novel idea mashups. Output feeds directly into the exponential experimentation pipeline, enabling discoveries beyond human combinatorial capacity. Fast, Kubernetes-native, and tightly integrated with mesh orchestration APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Surface at least 5× more novel concepts per week compared to current ideation approaches.
- Drive upstream innovation by fueling disruptive discovery workflows across the organization.
- Strengthen the company's IP pipeline and technical differentiation via accelerated creative exploration.
- Enable continuous improvement by integrating with experimentation, filtering, and ML feedback loops.

### User Goals

- Instantly discover unexpected cross-pollinations and creative links that would elude manual ideation.
- Receive ranked, highly novel concept combinations with transparent reasoning for "why this pairing."
- Trust that surfaced ideas are both relevant and sufficiently "out there" to spur true innovation.

### Non-Goals

- Will not include manual, user-driven graph combination (all auto-generated).
- Will not expose the full organizational knowledge graph to client use (API returns only generated combos and trace).
- Will not provide a full graphical graph management frontend (admin ops only).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.
- Innovation Leads: discover novel concept combinations for innovation projects.
- Product Managers: evaluate creative reasoning and ingredient trace for resource allocation.
- Researchers: provide feedback on combination outcomes to refine novelty rankings.
- Admins: manage access control and audit logging for knowledge graph operations.
- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- **As an Innovation Lead**, I want to receive a list of highly novel, non-obvious idea combinations seeded from my domain, so that I can rapidly evaluate and initiate new innovation projects.
- **As a Product Manager**, I want to see creative reasoning and ingredient trace for each suggested idea, so that I can justify experimentation and resource allocation.
- **As a Researcher**, I want to provide feedback on which combinations yielded valuable results in practice, so that the system refines future novelty rankings.
- **As an Admin**, I want fine-grained control over access and audit logging, so that knowledge graph traversal operations remain secure and compliant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all creativity generation and ranking endpoints.
- 100% audit trail coverage for all knowledge graph traversal events.
- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Idea generation response time <300ms, ranking <200ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access the Amplifier via dashboard widget or API integration with core idea pipeline tools.
- On initial use, onboarding presents a short guide: "How we find novel combinations" and sample outputs.
- If appropriate, users select or input seed concepts/domains.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User submits a core concept or selects a domain for idea expansion via UI or API.
  - Minimal data entry; typeahead for existing concepts, single-click to seed.
  - Validation ensures input concept exists in the mesh knowledge graph.
- **Step 2:** Service automatically traverses the knowledge graph (up to 6+ hops) to generate hundreds/thousands of non-obvious paired/multiway idea combos.
  - User receives progress notification if batch is large.
- **Step 3:** System applies advanced novelty scoring using past data, semantic distances, relevance, and pattern diversity.
  - Only the top-N ranked, high-novelty combos are returned for review.
- **Step 4:** Each combo is presented with "creative reasoning"—the pathway and logic connecting input to output.
  - Users can expand any combo to see a graph trace or semantic justifications.
- **Step 5:** User actions:
  - Save promising combos to personal/project lists.
  - Send selected combos directly into experimentation engine or research cycle.
  - Provide up/downvote or tagged outcome as feedback on system performance.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users can export result sets (CSV, JSON) or set up auto-subscription for weekly idea drops.
- Batch/system errors (e.g., graph overload, missing seed, generation timeout) prompt clear notifications and recovery suggestions.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Responsive, accessible widget styled for dashboard integration (font, contrast, keyboard nav).
- Creative reasoning is always transparent—never a "black box."
- Clear "try again" and "give me more like this" actions for iterative discovery.
- Secure and private—no sensitive graph data is exposed; all API comms RBAC-controlled.

## Narrative

Emily, a product strategist at a global tech firm, struggles to break out of the team's "echo chamber" of familiar, incremental product ideas. Traditional brainstorming sessions yield mostly safe, predictable combinations. With a looming innovation sprint, Emily turns to the Combinatorial Creativity Amplifier. She enters "remote sensor plus data privacy" as seed concepts. Within seconds, the system returns imaginative mashups—anonymized social-proof mesh for device calibration, encrypted on-device swarm learning, cross-domain ideas linking sensors to health, energy, and even public art.

The results aren't random; every combination includes a traceable pathway linking the seed to wild, yet plausible, new domains. Emily saves several, shoots the top three to the experimentation pipeline, and leaves feedback on the most inspired ones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

- **User-Centric Metrics**
  - ≥25% 'Aha!' click-through rate on surfaced combos in dashboard/widget
  - Hourly/daily/weekly engaged users sending combos into research or experimentation

  - Reduction in innovation cycle lead time by ≥30%
- **Technical Metrics**
  - ≥99% of batch operations meet <300ms generation, <200ms ranking NFRs
  - Service uptime ≥99.9%
  - <0.5% error rate across generation and ranking
- **Tracking Plan**
  - Track idea generation, novelty scoring, and user feedback events.
  - Monitor innovation project outcomes from generated ideas.
  - Log all knowledge graph traversal and combination generation activities.
  - Track cross-team adoption and creative output improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Highly efficient API endpoints for combo generation, ranking, and feedback integration
- Advanced graph traversal engine; persistent knowledge graph storage (Neo4j, TigerGraph, DGL, or hybrid)
- Scalable Kubernetes deployment with horizontal pod autoscaling for batch loads
- Session/context tracking per request for audit and feedback traceability

### Integration Points

- Direct handoff/API triggers to exponential experimentation engine
- Inputs from mesh orchestration service (user/event-driven)
- Feedback loop from Love-Driven Filtering Layer and experimentation outcomes

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Persistent graph DB; each traversal and generated combo logged with contextID
- No exposure of internal graph outside service boundaries (API only returns generated combos and trace)
- All user actions, submissions, and exports logged for audit/compliance

### Scalability & Performance

- System scales to 2,000+ combinations/sec; autoscaling pods and storage as demand rises
- Performance optimized for graph reads, pairwise scoring, and real-time ranking

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring privacy and security of sensitive org knowledge within the graph
- Deconflicting simultaneous batch requests from multiple innovation teams
- Maintaining high performance at graph scales (node/edge explosion at deeper hops)
- Handling "garbage" results—surfacing high-potential combos, not just "different for different's sake"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
