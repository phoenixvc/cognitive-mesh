# Systematic Innovation Rhythm PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

Automate and optimize the innovation cadence (Sunday reviews / Friday builds) for individual teams using Prefect workflow orchestration, MLflow impact logging, LightGBM-powered template recommendations, and DVC for artifact/version control. Core jobs and AI recommendations run as Helm-managed services on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provisioned via Bicep; end-users interact only via dashboards, plugins, or notifications through API endpoints.
