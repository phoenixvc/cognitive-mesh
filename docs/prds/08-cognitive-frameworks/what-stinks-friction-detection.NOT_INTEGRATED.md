# "What Stinks?" Friction Detection System PRD v2.0

### TL;DR

A continuous, metacognitive friction detection engine that analyzes workflow logs, dynamically surfaces inefficiencies, and explains "what stinks" using LlamaIndex (vector pattern search), Trulens (chain-of-thought capture), Chroma (history tracking), and Prefect (automated scanning/re-scanning). Deployed as a Helm/Bicep microservice on Azure, with widgets and CLI as thin API consumers.
