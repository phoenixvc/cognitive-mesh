# Unified Federated Data Query (DataMeshQuery)

### TL;DR

DataMeshQuery enables enterprise users to run federated SQL-like queries
over various structured and unstructured sources—including databases
(SQL/NoSQL), cloud stores, and tools like Slack, Notion, and
GitHub—using MCP-powered federation (e.g., MindsDB). The system provides
unified, normalized results, robust RBAC and audit logging, and is
delivered seamlessly through VS Code, mesh APIs, and a dashboard widget.
It delivers normalized insight, compliance, and radically simplified
analytics for technical teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Onboard at least 2 analytics teams within 3 weeks of launch.

- Ensure \<2 minutes for all non-cached federated queries in 95% of
  cases.

- Operate at a cost below €400 per 1,000 queries per month.

- Maintain comprehensive audit trails for every query and user action.

- Demonstrate regulatory compliance and secure data handling across all
  connected data sources.

### User Goals

- Empower users to run a single query across multiple, disparate data
  sources.

- Provide results in a normalized schema for easy downstream processing.

- Protect sensitive data with source-level RBAC and thorough audit logs.

- Allow configuration of source mappings, credentials, and saved queries
  via simple config files.

- Display intuitive, actionable errors when queries fail or sources are
  unreachable.

### Non-Goals

- The product is not designed as a general-purpose ETL or data pipeline.

- Will not support cross-source join queries or transformations in phase
  1.

- Not intended as a full BI or data visualization/reporting platform
  (external export is supported).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Analytics Users: Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and technical teams.

- Backend/Data Integration Leads: maintain adapters and config.

- DataOps Engineers: manage deployments and credentials.

- Security & Compliance Managers: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Personas:**

- Analytics User (primary: Data Analyst, Data Scientist)

- Product Owner

- Backend/Data Integration Lead

- DataOps Engineer

- Security & Compliance Manager

- QA/Test Automation

**User Stories:**

**Analytics User**

- As an analytics user, I want to write a single SQL-like query and
  retrieve results from multiple sources, so that I spend less time
  collecting and merging data.

- As an analytics user, I want to see which sources participated in my
  query, so that I understand data provenance.

- As an analytics user, I want to download/export results in CSV/JSON,
  so that I can analyze them further in my preferred tools.

**Product Owner**

- As a product owner, I want to monitor product usage and audit logs, so
  that I can track adoption and compliance.

**Backend/Data Integration Lead**

- As a backend lead, I want to add or change adapters for new sources,
  so that the platform stays relevant as our stack evolves.

**DataOps Engineer**

- As a DataOps engineer, I want to set up federated source mappings in
  config files, so that changes are manageable and repeatable.

- As a DataOps engineer, I want to set connection credentials and
  enforce RBAC, so that only authorized users access specific data.

**Security & Compliance Manager**

- As a compliance manager, I want to see a log of every query, its
  parameters, and execution context, so that we pass audits and meet
  data governance standards.

**QA**

- As a QA team member, I want to simulate failed queries and schema
  changes, so that the platform is reliable and error-tolerant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Core Querying & User Experience** (Priority: P0)

  - VS Code: Provide a snippet command to run federated queries and
    display normalized results in-table.

  - Mesh API: Expose a REST endpoint for federated queries with
    normalized results, pagination, and streaming support.

  - Config: Read from .datamesh/config.yaml with source definitions,
    credential management, and query defaults.

  - Adapter Plugins: Ship at least 3 adapters in v1 (MySQL, Cosmos DB,
    Slack), and framework for fast adapter addition.

  - Mesh Query Planner: Optimize and parallelize federated querying;
    merge results to unified schema.

  - Pagination & Streaming: Support query cursors for large results and
    paginated API/UI.

  - Audit Logging: Automatically record all queries (user, source,
    parameters, results, cost, errors).

- **Governance & Security** (Priority: P0)

  - Enforce RBAC per query, per data source (via group/role in platform
    AAA).

  - Encrypt all queries and results at rest and in transit.

  - Store immutable logs of query metadata, auth context, and execution
    environment.

- **Advanced Features** (Priority: P1)

  - Dashboard Widget: Display saved queries, run ad-hoc queries,
    view/download results.

  - Export/Download: Enable one-click export of results in CSV/JSON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥95% of federated queries complete within 2 minutes (P95 latency).

- 100% audit trail coverage for all queries and user actions.

- 99.9% uptime for query execution and API endpoints.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users discover DataMeshQuery via the VS Code extension marketplace or
  platform documentation.

- On installation, users are prompted to link API credentials, download
  config templates, and test their first connection.

- A guided onboarding screen explains default queries, the structure of
  .datamesh/config.yaml, and adapter modules.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1: Compose Query**

  - User opens a new DataMeshQuery file or VS Code snippet and writes a
    SQL-like query.

  - The system validates the query syntax and identifies required data
    sources from config.

- **Step 2: Execute Query**

  - User triggers "Run Federated Query"; MCP server receives query,
    loads config, and invokes mesh planner.

  - Query is parallelized across adapters; results are normalized and merged.

  - User receives results in-table or via API, with provenance and error reporting.

- **Step 3: Review & Export**

  - User reviews results, downloads/export as needed, and can save queries for future use.

  - All actions are logged for audit and compliance.

**Edge Cases**

- Source fails or is unreachable: user is notified; system documents failure with reason and error log.

- Policy/compliance block: user is alerted and given remediation path.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Consistent, high-contrast grid display; responsive layout for
  wide/narrow results.

- Data provenance and RBAC visibly surfaced (e.g., lock icon for
  restricted sources).

- Download/export is always an explicit user action—no silent exports.

- Accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader support in widget.

- Dashboard widget displays last run, success/error state, and saved
  queries for fast rerun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

A data analyst at a multinational company needs to quickly aggregate sales and support data from multiple cloud sources. Using DataMeshQuery, she writes a single SQL-like query in VS Code. The system federates the query across MySQL, Cosmos DB, and Slack, returning a unified, normalized result set. She reviews the results, exports them to CSV, and shares with her team. When a source is unreachable, the system flags the error and provides a remediation path. All actions are logged for compliance, and the analyst's workflow is radically simplified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
