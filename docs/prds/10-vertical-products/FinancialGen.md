# MCP-Powered Financial Analyst (FinancialGen)

### TL;DR

FinancialGen is an MCP-enabled tool designed for rapid, one-click
financial data analysis. It seamlessly fetches market time-series
(stocks, crypto), computes analytics, generates clear visualizations,
and delivers narrative insights—all accessible via IDE snippet or a
unified Mesh API. Targeted towards analysts and finance teams, it
slashes reporting time and empowers rapid, automated decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Deploy to ≥2 finance/analytics teams within 3 weeks

- Reduce report creation time from hours to \<30s per symbol

- Maintain costs at ≤€250/month for 2,000 analyses

- Achieve ≥10 active users weekly post-launch

### User Goals

- Enable one-command or API-triggered analysis, charts, and insights

- Support analysis for multiple symbols, custom ranges, and metrics

- Deliver easy export in JSON, Markdown, or CSV formats

- Guarantee secure access with audit and RBAC controls

### Non-Goals

- Not for live trading or order execution

- Not a full BI replacement or complex ETL system

- No support for deeply custom analytics extensions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Financial Analysts: primary users of the tool.

- Developers: integrate analytics into pipelines and maintain APIs.

- Data Team Leads: oversee compliance and activity logging.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Financial Analyst**

- As a financial analyst, I want to analyze stock data for multiple
  tickers in seconds, so that I can focus on insight, not data
  wrangling.

- As a financial analyst, I want clear visualizations and narratives, so
  that reporting is easily understandable for stakeholders.

- As a financial analyst, I want to export findings in Markdown or CSV,
  so that I can integrate results into my own slides or documents.

**Persona: Developer**

- As a developer, I want an API to programmatically analyze financial
  data, so that I can integrate analytics into automated pipelines.

- As a developer, I want to select which NLP model writes the narrative,
  so that I can balance speed vs. output depth.

**Persona: Data Team Lead**

- As a team lead, I want to see all analysis activity logged, so that
  compliance and cost controls are easy to audit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Analysis Core** (Priority: P0)

  - FR1: VS Code snippet that fetches asset time-series, analyzes
    metrics, generates charts, and writes a narrative story (Phase 1)

  - FR3: Unified Mesh API endpoint analyzeFinancials exposed for broader
    integration (Phase 2)

- **Visualization & Export** (Priority: P1)

  - FR2: In-editor chart preview (as Base64/URL in output panel) (Phase
    1)

  - FR4: Support for chart types: line, bar, scatter, correlation
    heatmap (Phase 2)

  - FR6: Export results as JSON, Markdown, or CSV (Cross-Phase)

- **Usability & Flexibility** (Priority: P2)

  - FR5: Model profile option, allowing the user to select between e.g.,
    GPT-4o or GPT-4.1 for narrative quality/speed (Phase 3)

- **Governance & Security** (Priority: P0/P1, Cross-Phase)

  - FR-Gov1: Automatically check all narrative output for PII or
    hallucination before displaying to user

  - FR-Gov2: Log all analysis invocations, parameters, and outputs for
    thorough audit/compliance

  - FR-Gov3: Enforce RBAC on API and snippet access, leveraging Azure AD

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥95% of analyses complete within 30 seconds per symbol (P95 latency).

- 100% audit trail coverage for all analyses and user actions.

- 99.9% uptime for analysis execution and API endpoints.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users discover the feature as a "Roo: Analyze Financials" command in
  VS Code or see it listed in the Mesh API documentation.

- First use includes a simple onboarding dialog: enter market data
  credentials if necessary, select default analytics profile.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User enters one or more symbols, a date range, and chooses
  which metrics to analyze (returns, volatility, correlation).

  - UI validates ticker symbols and metric names, offers smart defaults.

- **Step 2:** Backend fetches time-series data, computes analytics, and
  generates visualizations (line/bar/scatter/correlation).

  - User is shown progress with a spinner/loading bar and status
    updates.

- **Step 3:** Narrative summary is produced via LLM; charts and raw
  analytics are presented for review.

  - Results shown as: JSON summary (left panel), analysis narrative and
    charts (right panel), color-coded and accessible.

- **Step 4:** User can export or copy the results in their preferred
  format (Markdown with images, CSV, JSON).

- **Step 5:** Advanced: User can tweak model profile to trade off speed
  and detail, or trigger further ad-hoc analyses on new ticker inputs.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Handles API failures gracefully: prompts for credential errors,
  expiry, or unclear data

- Displays warnings if chart data is incomplete or metrics are invalid

- Provides suggestions or auto-fixes for common ticker/metric typos

**UI/UX Highlights**

- High-contrast, readable charts and summaries

- Export buttons with clear format selection

- All features fully keyboard-navigable

- Accessible color schemes and legends

## Narrative

Maria is a financial analyst, juggling daily requests for market insight
from a dynamic fintech team. Each morning, she spends hours collecting
stock data, running calculations in spreadsheets, and formatting the
findings into presentable charts—often battling inconsistent data and
tight reporting deadlines.

With FinancialGen, Maria simply opens VS Code, runs the "Analyze
Financials" command, enters her tickers and analysis window, and within
seconds receives a comprehensive report: market analytics, neatly
formatted charts, and a narrative summary suitable for immediate
distribution. The tool offers flexible export options, integrates
directly into her team's workflow, and ensures that all sensitive
activity is logged and compliant, enabling Maria to spend time on what
matters: making decisions, not chasing data.
