# PRD Generation & Orchestration Toolkit (PRDGen)

### TL;DR

PRDGen automates and iterates Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation and modification, injecting live code and documentation context, enforcing strict schemas, and supporting the full PRD lifecycle. Everything is mesh-native and governed for audit, compliance, and extensibility across teams.

---

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Achieve adoption by at least 3 internal teams within 2 weeks of release
- Enable generation of full PRDs in under 5 minutes
- Maintain monthly cloud/model costs below €500 for the first 5,000 calls

### User Goals
- Instantly generate, edit, and validate PRDs directly from code or documentation
- Guarantee schema consistency and cross-team standards in generated PRDs
- Streamline revision, feedback, and approval cycles with clear, auditable tracking

### Non-Goals
- Not intended as a generic documentation tool
- Not intended as a full-featured, web-based PRD editor in the initial release

---

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner
- Product Managers (PMs)
- Backend and AI Engineers
- QA Team
- Security and Compliance Officers
- Documentation and UX Specialists
- DevOps

---

## User Stories
- As a PM, I want to generate a PRD from a feature prompt so that I can quickly start a new product initiative.
- As a PM, I want to revise and track changes to PRDs so that all feedback and approvals are auditable.
- As an engineer, I want PRDs to include live code and documentation context so that requirements are always up to date.
- As a compliance officer, I want to review audit logs for all PRD modifications so that regulatory requirements are met.

---

## Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** Mesh-based PRD generation and iteration tool
- **FR2:** PRD modify/revision flow with persistent audit trail
- **FR3:** Schema-driven PRD output, available in JSON via function-calling
- **FR4:** Automatic contextual injection from live code and documentation
- **FR5:** Support for model profile selection (speed, cost, accuracy)
- **FR6:** Change tracking and revision management with user feedback loop
- **FR-Gov1:** A/B prompt and output evaluation harness, content safety filter, audit logging on all PRD modifications
- **FR-Gov2:** Role-based access control (RBAC) scoped by project/team

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1:** 95th percentile request latency < 1 second
- **NFR2:** Scalable to 100 requests per second
- **NFR3:** 99.9% service uptime
- **NFR4:** Secure cloud operation (TLS, region compliance, managed secrets)
- **NFR5:** ≥90% schema and content validation pass rate for all generated PRDs

---

## User Experience
1. **User Input:** User enters a feature or specification prompt in VS Code or via API.
2. **Context Fetch:** System fetches relevant code and documentation context automatically.
3. **Generation & Validation:** PRD is generated per schema, visible in both JSON and markdown.
4. **Revision & Tracking:** User iterates with revision cycles, comments, approvals; all changes are tracked and auditable.
5. **Prompt A/B Evaluation:** Integrated feedback and A/B testing for model output optimization.
6. **Export & Handoff:** After approval, user exports PRD to documentation or hands off to engineering.

---

## Narrative
A product manager is tasked with launching a new feature. Using PRDGen, she enters a feature prompt in VS Code. The system fetches relevant code and documentation, generates a schema-compliant PRD, and presents it for review. She iterates with her team, tracking all revisions and approvals. The compliance officer reviews the audit log, and after final approval, the PRD is exported to the engineering team. The process is fast, transparent, and fully auditable.

---

## Success Metrics
- Number of teams using PRDGen within the first month.
- Percentage of PRDs generated in under 5 minutes.
- User satisfaction scores (CSAT/NPS) for PRD workflow.
- Audit/compliance pass rate for PRD logs.
- Number of PRD revisions and approvals managed per week.

---

## Tracking Plan
- Track PRD generation, revision, and approval events.
- Log all audit and compliance events.
- Monitor user feedback and export actions.
- Track error and remediation events.

---

## Technical Architecture & Integrations
- **RBAC Engine, Audit Logger, Schema Registry:** Role enforcement, full audit log, schema/source-of-truth.
- **PRDGen Engine(s), Function-Calling, A/B Evaluation Subsystem:** Generation/modification logic, model calls, prompt experiments.
- **Prompt Drift Monitor, Schema Validator, Content Safety Adapter:** Ensures schema/content validity, monitors compliance and hallucination drift.
- **Workflow/Revision Orchestrator, Approval & Policy Handler:** Controls stepwise revisions, approvals, and multi-role collaboration flows.
- **REST API Server, VS Code Widget, PRD Export Utility:** Surface for user interaction (API & UI), approval controls, team/project RBAC.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - /api/prdgen/generate: Generate new PRD
  - /api/prdgen/modify: Modify or revise an existing PRD
  - /api/prdgen/validate: Validate PRD against schema

### Schema & Sample Payloads

- **PRD Schema (JSON excerpt):**  
  { title, tl;dr, goals:\[\], user_stories:\[\], requirements:\[\],
  ux_flow:\[\], tech_details:\[\], milestones:\[\], ... }

- **Revision Event:**  
  { "event": "modified", "user": "jane", "timestamp": "...", "changes":
  {...} }

### Audit Event Taxonomy

- PRD Created (user, timestamp, content, inputs)

- PRD Modified (user, timestamp, diff, reason)

- Schema/Validation Failure (user, timestamp, errors)

- Approval Action (user, timestamp, action)

- A/B Evaluation Launch/Result (user, timestamp, models, output)

- Export Event (user, timestamp, destination)

All audit events are persistently stored and associated per PRD.

**Exit Criteria:** ≥3 teams actively using, 90%+ schema validation,
99.9% uptime, all audit events live.

## Success Metrics

- ≥3 teams regularly using PRDGen for their product specs

- PRD full-draft generation time consistently \<5 minutes

- 95th percentile service latency \<1s for all requests

- Schema and content validation pass rate ≥90% over all outputs

- System operating at \<€500/month for 5k calls (cloud cost)

- Complete audit coverage for every PRD lifecycle event

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Prompt Drift:** Controlled by versioned templates and prompt
  regression testing.

- **Codebase Overfit:** Regular retraining/validation on context
  relevance.

- **Schema Change Fatigue:** Policy for approval of schema changes;
  change log broadcast.

- **Cost Spikes:** Use model fallback/caching layers; usage alerts.

- **Compliance Gaps:** Enforcement of audit review, content safety
  scans.

## Open Questions

- Should PRD schemas support only JSON, or allow YAML/front-matter as
  well?

- Should PRDGen support non-English/multilingual PRDs and localized
  output?

- What's the optimal context granularity: file, function, class, or
  module?

- How much UI surface/control should users have over model parameters
  (template select, context depth, etc.)?

### Team Size & Composition

\<IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS: ALWAYS propose a smaller team size and simpler
phases. Presume a team that can move very fast. DO NOT propose a large
team an complex/long timeline - you are a startup!\> \<DEFINE roles
required (e.g., Product, Engineering, Design).

- Extra-small: 1 person who does everything.

- Small Team: 1–2 total people

- Medium Team: 3–5 total people

- Large Team: 6+ total people

### Suggested Phases (Example for Medium Project - remember to propose a smaller team and simpler phases, you tend to overestimate the team size and timeline. Use a lean startup mentality.)
