# Product Requirements Document: Prompt Generation & Optimization Suite (PromptOpt)

### TL;DR

PromptOpt is an enterprise mesh-native prompt lifecycle toolkit for modern AI teams. It enables seamless generation, evaluation, and refinement of prompts with robust governance, audit trails, versioning, and feedback mechanisms. Designed for prompt engineers and operational research teams seeking fast, adaptable, and responsible LLM or retrieval prompt development.

---

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Achieve engagement of at least 10 active prompt engineers within 2 weeks of launch.
- Ensure ≥80% of prompts consistently score above 4 out of 5 based on the internal QA rubric.
- Maintain an operational cost ceiling of €200 per 10,000 prompt cycles.
- Deliver compliance-ready prompt workflows, meeting 100% auditability and role-based access standards.

### User Goals
- Rapidly seed, generate, and refine prompt sets with full transparency.
- Easily compare prompt variants using A/B testing and score feedback.
- Track prompt effectiveness over versions and approve or roll back changes with one click.
- Govern prompt artifacts through detailed audit trails and robust feedback integration.

### Non-Goals
- Will not eliminate manual review in the prompt development lifecycle.
- Will not enforce model stability in fixed model/endpoint settings.
- Extensive custom plug-in marketplaces are out of current scope.

## User Experience
### Phase 1: Core Tooling
1. **Seed & Generate:** User runs `PromptOpt: Generate` in VS Code, enters seed text/context.
2. **Review Variants:** Tool displays 3–5 prompt variants; user annotates and favorites.
3. **Evaluate & Refine:** User invokes `PromptOpt: Evaluate` & `PromptOpt: Refine` within VS Code for real-time feedback.

### Phase 2: Mesh API Integration
- **Endpoints:** `/api/prompt/{generate,evaluate,refine,feedback,rollback}` supporting JSON inputs/outputs.
- **Workflow:** Services call APIs programmatically; audit logs and RBAC enforced.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **A/B Testing:** Launch live tests, compare conversion/performance metrics.
- **Template Packs:** Export/import packs with metadata and changelogs.

## Narrative
A prompt engineer is tasked with optimizing prompts for a new customer support LLM. Using PromptOpt, she seeds a set of initial prompts, generates variants, and runs A/B tests to compare performance. The system logs every change and feedback, allowing her to roll back to the best version instantly. QA analysts provide ratings and comments, and the compliance officer reviews the audit trail for regulatory sign-off. The result: faster, higher-quality prompt development with full transparency and governance.

---

## Success Metrics
- Number of active prompt engineers using PromptOpt weekly.
- Percentage of prompt variants scoring ≥4/5 in QA rubric.
- User satisfaction scores (CSAT/NPS) for prompt workflow.
- Audit/compliance pass rate for prompt logs.
- Number of prompt cycles and template packs managed per week.
