## User Stories

**Enterprise Architect**

- As an architect, I want to configure model orchestration routes (HuggingGPT), so that our organization’s best AI models are applied to each subtask most efficiently.
- As an architect, I want to govern agent-to-agent communication (Agent2Agent), so we can audit, secure, and monitor complex multi-agent workflows.

**Frontline Analyst**

- As an analyst, I want to transparently review each cognitive milestone and reflexion step, so I trust and can retrace AI-assisted deliverables.
- As an analyst, I want to surface or escalate errors and inconsistencies directly within the UI widgets, so issues are addressed before finalization.

**Compliance Manager**

- As a compliance manager, I need continuous dashboards of all AI, agentic, and user-driven events, so that we are always audit ready for EU/US/sectoral regulators.
- As a compliance manager, I want built-in soft-coercion/legal overlays and alerting for all risky behaviors or notifications.

**Financial Strategist**

- As a strategist, I want to deploy agentic financial decision workflows, so that autonomous strategies, compliance, and risk checks occur without human bottlenecks.

**Software Product Owner**

- As a product owner, I need a live overview of MetaGPT-style software engineering workflows, so I can monitor team role handoff, progress, error, and delivery in real time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users launch Cognitive Mesh v3 through an enterprise dashboard or as embeddable widgets within existing portals.
- Guided onboarding introduces orchestration, milestone workflow, reflexion/self-correction, and agent team features.
- First-use walk-through for configuring an orchestration workflow, enabling Reflexion, and connecting domain agents.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User configures orchestration (sets up HuggingGPT routes, agent registry, or preferred models)

  - Clean dropdowns, search, and plug-and-play integration with drag/drop UI.
  - Validation for model compatibility, SLAs, and skill attribution; errors with informative overlays.
  - Success: Agents and models are live; user sees visual orchestrator path.

- **Step 2:** User initiates a multi-agent workflow or knowledge task

  - Inputs task or selects from live knowledge map.
  - System dynamically routes via selected orchestration pattern; status updates in real time.

- **Step 3:** Widget displays cognitive milestones in progress (planning, retrieve, synthesize...)

  - Clear per-phase status, ability to step-back, branch, or flag for audit.
  - Reflexion overlay allows users to inspect and optionally override agent self-correction or improvement cycles.
  - Errors, warnings, and audit trails surfaced inline.

- **Step 4:** For MetaGPT/Financial/Team use cases, panelized widgets show agent team roles, task handoff, code/tests/results, backlog, and progress bars.

  - Users can step in/override any role; escalation triggers compliance, logging, and provenance.

- **Step 5:** Upon workflow completion, users see results, audit summaries, performance/quality dashboards, and can export reports or initiate next tasks.

- **Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

  - Edge-case handling: model/agent failures, platform sync loss, escalation for legal/compliance, fatigue mitigation.
  - Power-user controls for plug-in chains, prompt engineering, and agent configuration.
  - Multi-locale/cultural overlays and sectoral widgets (finance, healthcare, etc.) auto-switch based on user/org.

- **UI/UX Highlights**

  - Full accessibility: keyboard nav, contrast, locale, error overlays.
  - No action hidden: all steps/inputs auditable, recovery paths always available, step-back at every phase.
  - “Shared error envelope” for all runtime and API errors (see technical considerations).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

Cognitive Mesh v3 meets the enterprise challenge of AI orchestration and compliance at scale. An analyst facing unpredictable multi-modal data can assemble the right expert AI models in real time, trace every milestone, and rely on embedded audit, provenance, and reflexion overlays to monitor every decision. Developers and product owners simulate an entire MetaGPT team, swapping roles or agents as the project evolves, while compliance managers receive live audit dashboards mapped to every global standard. Financial strategists trust agentic workflows fully compliant with MiFID II and EU AI Act, but can step in at any abnormality. The entire ecosystem—down to plug-in chains, content provenance, and open-source standards—is modular, extensible, and research-backstopped. The outcome: measurable productivity, trust, and futureproof AI governance, all with minimal friction and full organizational transparency.
