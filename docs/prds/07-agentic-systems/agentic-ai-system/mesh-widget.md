# Agentic AI System Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Authority/Consent)

### TL;DR

Mesh widgets enable secure, transparent AI agent orchestration for users and admins—spanning agent control, real-time status, authority and consent management, and audit overlays. Every widget rigorously enforces contract-bound hexagonal adapters, directly mapped to backend agent APIs, with complete traceability, error handling, and accessibility baked in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Accelerate adoption of secure, compliant multi-agent orchestration across enterprises
- Minimize operational risk by making agent authority and consent transparent and auditable
- Reduce IT overhead by surfacing actionable status, approval, and error logs in real time
- Enable quick onboarding and safe extension of agentic capabilities via socketed widgets

### User Goals

- Empower users to delegate and supervise agentized workflows with confidence
- Give admins instant control over agent registry, authority, and escalation actions
- Ensure all risky agent actions require explicit, logged approval for peace of mind
- Provide real-time feedback and notification overlays for both normal and exceptional actions

### Non-Goals

- Do not build a full agent coding or authoring interface
- No marketplace or self-service agent upload by end-users
- Exclude automated remediation actions that bypass admins or users

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

### Persona: Mesh Admin

- As a Mesh Admin, I want to review and configure available agents in a registry viewer, so I can set or revoke authority in real-time.
- As a Mesh Admin, I want to escalate, approve, or deny agent actions directly via an authority/consent modal to maintain organizational compliance.
- As a Mesh Admin, I want to see a complete audit log overlay of all key agent actions and approvals for compliance review.

### Persona: Business User

- As a Business User, I want to trigger agent solutions for tasks and immediately see agent status via a banner, so I know when to intervene.
- As a Business User, I want to be prompted for consent before any agent takes high-privilege action on my behalf.
- As a Business User, I want to be notified if an agent is degraded, offline, or requires more oversight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Panel Components (All must strictly map to backend port/schema contracts):**
  - Agent Control Center (Priority: Must)
    - Displays all available agents, status, authority, and version
    - Allows drill-down, override, register/retire, and manual escalation
  - Agent Status Banner (Priority: Must)
    - Shows live agent/operation status; overlays warnings, offline, circuit, or authority/consent flags
  - Authority/Consent Modal (Priority: Must)
    - Triggers for every high-risk or privileged action; user or admin must approve/deny; all decisions logged
  - Registry Viewer (Priority: Should)
    - Allows full search, filter, and drill-down into agent capabilities and history
  - Audit/Event Log Overlay (Priority: Must)
    - Real-time and historical display of all agent invocations, consent events, escalations, errors (searchable by user, agent, correlationID)
- **Hexagonal Adapters (Apply to all panels):**
  - DataAPIAdapterPort (Agent data, registry, orchestration port)
  - ConsentAdapter (Gates all risky or authority-requiring workflows)
  - NotificationAdapter (Pushes status, error, and action banners)
  - TelemetryAdapter (Logs all widget loads, approvals, errors, version drifts)
- **Storybook/Cypress Test Matrix:**
  - For each panel/adapter: test Pass, Fail, Offline, Override, Circuit-breaker, Version drift/mismatch, Accessibility failure, Schema drift

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

- Users/admins access widgets via mesh dashboard, shell menu, or workflow triggers
- On first use, an onboarding modal explains agent status banners and the importance of consent/authority controls
- Users must acknowledge a short tutorial on agent risk, approval, and auditability

### Core Experience

- Step 1: User triggers a workflow or admin opens the Control Center
  - Widget requests agent list/status via DataAPIAdapterPort with schema validation
  - Minimal friction: Spinner + placeholder on load, soft-fail with persistent retry overlay if offline
- Step 2: Agent Status Banner displays current agent and workflow state
  - Dynamically overlays status: "idle", "executing", "awaiting approval", "offline", "circuit broken", or authority/consent required
  - Clicking banner offers quick escalation, retry, or opens Registry/Modal for advanced action
- Step 3: On high-authority or sensitive actions, Authority/Consent Modal appears
  - User/admin reviews action, reviews risk summary, and can Approve/Deny
  - All actions are logged (via TelemetryAdapter), with visual confirmation and correlationID displayed for traceability
- Step 4: Admin or power-user accesses Registry Viewer or Audit Log Overlay
  - Can filter by agent, user, authority event, error, date; export for compliance
- Step 5: On version/schema mismatch or authority drift, widget disables the affected action and overlays version/update warning

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Circuit-breaker: After repeated backend fails, persistent "Degraded—Retry Later" overlay until backend is healthy
- Authority or consent denied: All future actions by the agent are soft-blocked and logged; banners remain until action taken
- Accessibility failure: Widget disables itself, logs via TelemetryAdapter, and alerts support
- Offline: Widgets retry and show last known data if cache <30 min; overlays "offline" across interactive components
- Version drift: UI disables affected features, prompts user/admin to refresh or update

### UI/UX Highlights

- Highly visible status and consent overlays—cannot be missed by user/admin
- All overlays and banners follow a unified design pattern (color, layout, a11y tokens, interaction)
- All actions (approve, deny, escalate, export) are a11y-compliant, keyboard accessible, and responsive
- Persistent retry/feedback overlays in any degraded or error state
- Explicit versioning badge and alert shown if widget or schema is out-of-date

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

The enterprise mesh has evolved—now, business users hand tasks off to a network of compliant, autonomous agents, but with full confidence that their oversight matters. When Jane, an Operations Manager, delegates a multi-step process to the mesh, she watches the Agent Status Banner light up: her agent is active, healthy, and within approved authority.

Suddenly, the agent requests an action beyond its usual scope. Instantly, the Authority/Consent Modal surfaces, and Jane reviews and approves the request—knowing her approval is logged for both her and compliance. Later, Jane's admin checks the real-time Audit Log Overlay, finding every agent action captured and traceable with colored indicators for overrides and escalations.

There are no hidden corners, no untraceable leaps of "autonomy." The mesh's transparency and control converts employee anxiety into decisiveness, and shifts compliance from a blocker to a business enabler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- % of high-authority agent actions approved/denied via modal without backend error
- End-user and admin satisfaction scores (via direct in-widget prompt)
- Average time to resolve agent escalation or consent event
- <2% widget disablement due to schema or version drift

### Business Metrics

- Number and % of workflows transitioned to agentic orchestration post-launch
- Reduction in IT support for agent/permissions-related issues
- Mean time to detect and resolve unauthorized or risky actions

### Technical Metrics

- 99.95% uptime for DataAPI/Consent/Notification adapters
- <250ms P99 response on status/authority registry calls
- <1% contract or error envelope mismatches in production traffic

### Tracking Plan

- Agent registry load, agent invocation, registry changes
- Consent modal shown, action taken (approve/deny)
- Authority override/escalation events
- Widget version drift or a11y disable
- Error and offline overlays, retry usage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Strongly contract-bound adapters for every AgentRegistry, Orchestration, Authority, Audit, and Consent API
- Strict versioning: widget disables on schema drift or breaking change
- Fully isolated widgets for safe embedding (sandboxed, no cross-widget memory leak)
- End-to-end correlationIDs for every event for reliable auditing

### Integration Points

- Cognitive Mesh platform shell for widget hosting/embed
- Backend agent APIs (gRPC/REST) and event bus for audit/notification
- Admin SSO/IDP for access to registry and authority functions

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No persistent storage in the widget; all data cached in-memory <30 min TTL, wiped on schema change or logout
- Adapters return only data required for the current action/screen
- All approval/consent actions pass correlationID and userID to backend for audit trail

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for concurrency: 1000+ active widgets per org
- Sub-1s cold-start, <250ms P99 for any adapter call
- Persistent retry/overlay with capped backoff for offline or degraded network

### Potential Challenges

- Version or contract mismatch leading to widget disablement (requires CI gating)
- Authority/consent flows under high concurrency (ensure queueing, no races)
- Maintaining a11y-first overlays and modals through rapid mesh upgrades
- Ensuring correlation between frontend consent events and backend logs for audit completeness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Architecture Integration & Component Mapping

The functionality in this PRD extends **existing cognitive-mesh UI components** rather than introducing an entirely new stack. The table and notes below map new widgets, ports, and adapters to the current layered hexagonal architecture, calling out *exact* files or interfaces that must be created or amended.

| New Component | Action Required | Integration Point(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent Control Center**<br>**Agent Status Banner**<br>**Authority/Consent Modal**<br>**Registry Viewer**<br>**Audit/Event Log Overlay** | • Create new React components for each widget (`src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Panels/`).<br>• Register each via `IWidgetRegistry.RegisterWidgetAsync()` with a unique `WidgetDefinition`. | • `IWidgetRegistry` (`src/UILayer/Core/WidgetRegistry.cs`) to make them available in the dashboard.<br>• `DashboardLayoutService` (`src/UILayer/Services/DashboardLayoutService.cs`) to manage their position and state.<br>• Rendered by the main dashboard shell. |
| **DataAPIAdapterPort** (UPDATE) | • Extend the existing `IDataAPIAdapterPort` to include methods for calling the new backend endpoints (`/v1/agent/registry`, `/v1/agent/orchestrate`, `/v1/agent/authority`).<br>• Implement the adapter to consume the backend's OpenAPI spec. | • `IAgencyWidgetAdapters.cs` (or a new `.ts` file).<br>• Consumes endpoints from the new backend services.<br>• Uses standardized `ErrorEnvelope` model. |
| **ConsentAdapter** (UPDATE) | • Extend the existing `IConsentAdapter` to handle consent flows specific to high-authority agent actions.<br>• The consent request must be triggered before calling any privileged agent endpoint. | • `IConsentAdapter` (`src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Adapters/IAgencyWidgetAdapters.cs`).<br>• Triggers the shared `Consent/Notification Modal` component. |
| **NotificationAdapter** (UPDATE) | • Extend the existing `INotificationAdapter` to handle new notification types for agent status changes, errors, and escalations. | • `INotificationAdapter` (`src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Adapters/IAgencyWidgetAdapters.cs`).<br>• Displays alerts using the shared notification banner component. |
| **TelemetryAdapter** (UPDATE) | • Extend the existing `ITelemetryAdapter` to log new event types: `AgentInvoked`, `AuthorityConsentGranted`, `AgentActionAudited`. | • `ITelemetryAdapter` (`src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Adapters/IAgencyWidgetAdapters.cs`).<br>• Uses the `TelemetryEvent` model (`src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Models/AgencyWidgetModels.cs`). |
| **Shared UX Pattern Library** (UPDATE) | • Add new shared components for the Agent Status Banner, Authority/Consent Modal, and Audit Log Overlay. | • Resides in `src/UILayer/AgencyWidgets/Components/`.<br>• Ensures visual and functional consistency across all widgets. |
