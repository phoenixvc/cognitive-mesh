# Pressure-to-Performance Transformation Engine PRD

### TL;DR

Detects user cognitive overload in real-time tasks—such as lags, errors, or stress—and instantly adapts the level of AI assistance (FULL, SELECTIVE, MINIMAL), restoring optimal performance. The engine operates as a mesh sidecar service and automatically scales with demand.
