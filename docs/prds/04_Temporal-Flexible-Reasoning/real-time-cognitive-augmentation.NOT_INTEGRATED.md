# Real-Time Cognitive Augmentation Layer PRD

### TL;DR

Mesh service that detects human cognitive bottlenecks in live tasks—such as throughput, memory gaps, and overload—and injects AI augmentation tools (transcription, contextual recall, real-time pattern recognition) to instantly boost accuracy and decision speed. Targeted for teams and users operating under high pressure or cognitive load.
