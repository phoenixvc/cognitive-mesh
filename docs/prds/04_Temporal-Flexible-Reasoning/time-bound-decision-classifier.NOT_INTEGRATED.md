# Time-Bound & Data-Based Decision Classifier PRD

### TL;DR

A mesh-integrated service that analyzes the context and characteristics of each decision—such as deadline, data complexity, and subjectivity—and automatically classifies tasks as AI-ESSENTIAL, HUMAN-FIRST, or BALANCED. It then routes each decision accordingly, reducing errors and maximizing workflow efficiency.
