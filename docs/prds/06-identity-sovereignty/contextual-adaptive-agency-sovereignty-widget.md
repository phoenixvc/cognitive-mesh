# Contextual Adaptive Agency Sovereignty Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered)

### TL;DR

Contextual Adaptive Agency Mesh Widgets give end-users real-time visibility and control over the autonomy, agency, authority (AAA), and sovereignty of their AI and agentic systems. They standardize overlays, consent points, escalation paths, and audit UI—enabling seamless personalization, compliance, and trust. Shared adapters, rigorous UX patterns, and fully automated CI/test harnesses guarantee transparency, resilience, and organizational adoption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Enable organizational trust and adoption of adaptive agentic AI through transparent, user-configurable controls.
- Raise compliance and auditability for all agentic decisions/actions across the mesh.
- Reduce risk of autonomy/agency drift; avoid "black-box" agent behaviors.
- Accelerate rollout by providing a plug-and-play panel portfolio for all mesh agent UIs.

### User Goals

- Instantly see and adjust the level of agent autonomy and authority before action is taken.
- Get clear, consistent overlays for errors, consent, and policy escalations—never miss a critical state.
- Understand exactly who/what is acting, with human authorship/status always visible.
- Seamless, interruption-free workflows, even during escalations, error, or authority drift.

### Non-Goals

- Not enforcing specific AAA or policy choices—simply surfacing and honoring configured org rules.
- Not supporting legacy (&lt;1.0) agent or mesh endpoints lacking AAA/contextual APIs.
- Not building a full agent authoring interface—focus is on runtime status/exposure, not creation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

### User Personas

- **Knowledge Worker (Jess):** Everyday user interacting with adaptive agents for writing, scheduling, or research.
- **Compliance Officer (Irfan):** Needs real-time insight and traceability for all agentic actions.
- **Admin/Integrator (Priya):** Sets organizational defaults, receives update and deprecation notifications, manages escalations.

### Stories

- As a Knowledge Worker, I want to instantly see when an agent is set to full autonomy, so that I can decide whether to confirm, override, or adjust the workflow.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want every agent-initiated action to be logged and accessible by correlationID, so that audits are simple and reliable.
- As an Admin, I want to receive advance warning about widget deprecations and required migration steps, so integrations remain operational.
- As a Knowledge Worker, I want error and consent modals to behave and look the same, no matter which panel I use, so my experience is predictable and trustworthy.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want policy decision tables to be visible in the UI alongside the relevant agency controls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

### Core Panels/Widgets (Priority: Must)

- **Agency Mode Banner:** Real-time, always-on indicator showing autonomy/agency/authority; user can surface details and adjust if policy allows.
- **AAA Control Center:** Panel lets user/admin raise/lower autonomy, review current scope of authority/agent permissions, and see all policy limits in effect.
- **Sovereignty Status Overlay:** Highly visible UI element showing authorship state, overrides, or any agent/human mode switch.
- **Consent/Notification Modal:** Renders for all user approval events, escalations, or authority drift—standardized layout, supports blocking actions.
- **Policy Decision Table Viewer:** Renders live CIA/CSI policy mappings to explain why a given agency mode is chosen.

### Mesh Adapters (All Priority: Must)

- **DataAPIAdapterPort:** Interfaces with backend adaptive agency router (OpenAPI: `/docs/spec/adaptive-agency.yaml#/paths/1v11agency-mode~1get`).
- **ConsentAdapter:** Sends/receives all user consent and override flows.
- **NotificationAdapter:** Pushes all warnings, escalations, policy changes to user.
- **TelemetryAdapter:** Streams all action, error, and status events for compliance and product analytics.
- **ThemeAdapter:** Enforces style consistency and accessibility (a11y) compliance.

### UX/Pattern Library (Must)

- 'Retry' overlays, error banners, consent dialogs, button states, AAA toggles all implemented as shared UI modules; each panel invokes them identically.

### Storybook/Cypress Matrix (Must)

- All panels/adapters tested for: normal, error, offline, override, circuit-break, version drift, explicit deprecation, all theme/a11y modes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

- Mesh widget loads on home/dashboard/workflow page.
- Agency Mode Banner is always visible; first-time users see a short onboarding overlay explaining its purpose.
- Initial user journey auto-detects org defaults, syncs user preferences, and provides a "learn more" link to full AAA Control Center.

### Core Experience

- **Step 1:** User begins a task involving an agent (e.g., document summary).
  - Agency Mode Banner immediately reflects the currently configured autonomy/agency/authority ("Full Agentic," "Partial with Consent," "Sovereignty-First").
  - Banner color/symbol gives at-a-glance understanding (e.g., green for human-led, amber for consent-required).
- **Step 2:** User clicks the banner or is auto-prompted for escalation/consent.
  - Sovereignty Status Overlay appears if agency has changed via policy/context, always showing authorship status.
  - If required, Consent/Notification Modal blocks further action, asking the user to review and approve or override the next agentic action.
- **Step 3:** User opens the AAA Control Center to review/adjust agent parameters.
  - See a live table of agent permissions, policy limits, and a current-context mapping (explained via Policy Decision Table Viewer), e.g. "CIA > 0.6 → Consent Required".
  - UI dynamically updates on agent drift or override.
- **Step 4:** On action, outcome, or error, a standardized overlay appears.
  - All overlays, alerts, modals, and escalations rendered from the shared pattern library; UI always feels coherent and predictable.
  - All telemetry/events logged in real-time via TelemetryAdapter, visible in compliance/audit trail.
- **Step 5:** Responsive theme/a11y adaptation.
  - User can toggle light/dark, high contrast; all overlays adapt. Any a11y violation disables panels and triggers telemetry alert.

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Power users can script agency overrides (if allowed by policy).
- If agent or widget is offline, shows standardized retry banner; user can cache action for later submission.
- Any schema or version drift triggers a deprecation overlay, disabling action and instructing to update/migrate.
- If circuit-break is open, Consent/Notification Modal describes and blocks further agent action until resolved.

### UI/UX Highlights

- All errors, escalations, consent events look/function identically—no UI "drift."
- Visual status and control are always above the fold; banners are never hidden by scroll or modal layering.
- Policy explanations map to context—"Why is the agent blocked?"—in plain language.
- Accessibility first: all controls have clear focus states, high contrast, and ARIA tagging; a11y issues render a "panel disabled" UI and log a compliance event.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

Jess, a knowledge worker, logs in to her organization's mesh interface. She's preparing a sensitive client report, knowing policy requires transparency on any AI assistance. The Agency Mode Banner at the top of her screen glows amber—her org has toggled "Consent-Required" mode for this task, due to the document's sensitivity.

She clicks the banner, pulling up the AAA Control Center. The Sovereignty Status Overlay informs her she retains authorship, with a small notice: "Any agent action needs your review." As she tries summarizing a section, the Consent Modal smoothly slides in—showing the agent's suggested output, its authority scope, and a clear approve/override choice. She toggles to the Policy Decision Table Viewer, confirming that current policy mapping ("high CIA score") indeed necessitates this extra check.

Jess hits "Accept," and the action completes. The mesh instantly logs every agentic step into the audit trail, and the overlays fade back to normal. Later, the admin Priya receives a dashboard alert that this widget will require migration next month—a deprecation banner is already in place to avoid surprises. Jess always feels in control; compliance gets a robust record; engineering can sleep knowing every scenario, mode, and panel was fully covered—no drift, no confusion, total trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- Daily/monthly active users engaging with Agency Mode Banner, Control Center, or overlays
- User-reported confidence in agent authorship/consent ("I always know when and how agents act on my behalf")
- Error/incident rate for missed consent or misattributed agent actions (should fall below 0.5% of all agentic activity)

### Business Metrics

- Percentage of enterprise orgs who complete widget integration and maintain weekly operational status
- Deprecation/update events with <2 hours of admin downtime
- Compliance audits passed (all actions traceable with full AAA and consent provenance)

### Technical Metrics

- 99.99% uptime for all adapter calls, overlays rendered in <250ms under P99 load
- Zero contract version drift between widget and backend for >99% of sessions (CI catch/fix prior to prod)
- Accessibility audit passes per release, <1% a11y compliance incidents

### Tracking Plan

- Panel/adapter load events
- Banner/overlay impressions & clicks
- Consent/override modal opens/accepts/rejects
- Policy decision table views
- Version drift and deprecation alerts rendered
- Error, retry, offline, and circuit-break event telemetry
- a11y enable/disable events

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Strictly typed TypeScript interface for widget core (ports, adapters, models).
- Integration with mesh backend via OpenAPI-driven API client (DataAPIAdapterPort).
- IndexedDB/localStorage caching for offline and stale-data fallback.
- Telemetry, feedback, and error handling through separate outbound ports.

### Integration Points

- Mesh dashboard shell (WidgetLifecyclePort, RendererAdapter).
- OpenAPI contract—CI pipeline fails on version drift.
- Mesh-wide telemetry and error logging API.
- Consent and provenance management infrastructure.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All widget state is session/local cached—no persistent PII or usage data locally.
- Consent and provenance strictly surfaced as required by organizational policy.
- All user-initiated actions logged against user session for trace/audit.

### Scalability & Performance

- Widget must function across millions of dashboard loads; supports hot/cold code splitting for performance.
- Caching TTLs adjustable via dashboard settings.

### Potential Challenges

- API schema drift or mesh contract versioning mismatch.
- Handling abrupt theme/context changes without visual flicker.
- Maintaining robust offline-first and recovery capability at scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestones & Sequencing

### Project Estimate

- Medium: 2–4 weeks initial build (core widgets, ports, adapters, test harness); 1–2 weeks post-launch iteration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Error Envelope, Retry, Offline, Caching, Accessibility

- **Error Envelope Schema:** `{ "error_code": string, "message": string, "correlationID": string }`. [See Error Envelope Appendix]
- **Retry:** Exponential, initial 250ms, doubling to 1s, ±50ms jitter, max 3 attempts; fallback to offline batch after.
- **Caching:** All panel and adapter states TTL 30 minutes; invalidate on backend policy, circuit break, schema version, or user switch.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Widget-specific NFRs: Bundle <300kB, cold start <1s, telemetry flush <10s, a11y pass mandatory.
  - Any a11y error disables the panel, logs heartbeat/alert to TelemetryPort, overlays "Accessibility Issue" to user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cross-Panel Shared UX Patterns

### Shared Pattern Library

- Retry overlays, error banners, consent dialogs, button affordances, AAA sliders/toggles, theming.
- **Acceptance:** All panels use the exact shared overlays/components for visual/behavioral consistency.
- UI/UX lint and screenshot testing required for every panel per release.
- **Controls:** Always "above the fold," keyboard/screen reader accessible, responds to theme/a11y state.

### Visuals: Inline Component & Sequence Diagrams

- **Component diagram:** Panels ↔ Adapters ↔ Mesh SDKs ↔ Backend router.
- **Sequence flow:** User → Agency Banner/Overlay → Adapter → Backend → Consent/Escalation Modal → Telemetry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Versioning, Deprecation, Notification

- Widgets are semver-ed, APIs contract-bound. Registry disables on detected version drift, displays "Please update" overlay.
- **Change events:** Consumer admins notified via email, Slack, dashboard at 60/30/10 days before widget or contract sunset.
- Registry publish requires consumer acknowledgement; fail to sign off disables deploy.
- Migration docs shipped with all major/breaking changes or deprecations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Telemetry, Analytics Event Schema, Governance

- **Telemetry Event Schema**
  - `{ timestamp, widgetId, panelId, userId, correlationID, action, error_code }`
  - All events batch to compliance/audit feed within 10s; offline queue for network loss.
  - Policy change, override, error, and circuit-break events are logged with full context and made available to compliance/admin users.

### Data-Driven Policy Decision Example

| CSI/CIA Score | Policy                  | Agent Mode          | User Control        |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <0.4          | Direct Execution        | Full Autonomous     | Override available  |
| 0.4–0.7       | Escalation Required     | Consent (user)      | Block/Approve modal |
| >0.7          | Sovereignty Enforced    | Human-in-the-Loop   | Author must confirm |

*All decision/routing tables are visible to users and configurable by org policy.*
