# Cognitive Mesh Context Engineering Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Multi-Framework, Testable)

### TL;DR

Mesh widgets empower users, developers, and organizations to surface,
manage, correct, and audit context across all major frameworks—impact,
safety, passion, identity, velocity, value, and more. The suite provides
panels for memory and context visualization, context degradation
syndrome (CDS) detection/alert, session summaries, and override
controls, all directly mapped to backend contracts and fully CI-gated
for reliability, auditability, and organizational trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Ensure production-grade reliability in context management for all
  deployed cognitive mesh workflows.

- Reduce context-related AI failures by >80% compared to legacy
  implementations.

- Boost user trust and organizational adoption—measured by a 2X increase
  in AI-assisted task completions.

- Support rapid onboarding and audit via transparent visualization of
  all context flows and memory operations.

- Enable compliance with organizational policies—context drift,
  migration, and CDS events are always captured and actionable.

### User Goals

- Let end users immediately spot and fix context drift, CDS, or memory
  issues to avoid AI errors.

- Give admins and auditors complete visibility into session history,
  context handling, and critical deviation events.

- Offer devs and power users granular, framework-specific context
  inspection and override tools (impact, safety, passion, etc.).

- Surface timely and actionable CDS alerts—no more silent context
  failures.

- Provide policy-driven contextual controls without complex scripts or
  tool switching.

### Non-Goals

- Does not duplicate the backend's context orchestration logic (no
  direct manipulation or orchestration of backend state outside of
  provided APIs).

- No training of new AI/ML models within the widgets—tools operate
  strictly within context visualization, correction, and policy
  boundaries.

- Does not serve as a generic memory or logging widget for non-cognitive
  mesh platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**End User / Org Contributor**

- As an end user, I want to receive clear alerts when context degrades,
  so that I can step in before AI outputs suffer.

- As an end user, I want to review and edit session summaries, so that
  persistent mistakes or omissions are not perpetuated in future
  interactions.

- As an end user, I want granular controls for undoing, restoring, or
  commenting on memory changes, so that I can maintain agency and
  correct issues on-the-fly.

**Admin / Auditor**

- As an admin, I want a provenance log for all memory and context
  actions, so I can audit for compliance and performance.

- As an auditor, I want to be notified of unreconciled CDS events or
  context drift, so I can enforce timely resolutions.

- As an admin, I want to configure CDS, migration, and error-handling
  overlays via YAML, so that enterprise policy is implemented
  consistently.

**Developer / Context Engineer**

- As a developer, I want to directly map widget adapters to OpenAPI
  endpoints, so change and test coverage is always in sync with backend
  contracts.

- As a context engineer, I want a visual timeline and detailed memory
  breakdown per framework, so I can debug and optimize system behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Panel Portfolio** (Priority: High)

  - ContextDashboard: Central view for session and framework context
    state.

  - MemoryViewer: Displays working, session, long-term, episodic memory;
    supports diff/rollback.

  - CDSDriftOverlay: Visual overlay for context degradation events;
    provides user fix and feedback capture.

  - SessionSummaryEditor: Allows editing and approval of
    session/long-term summaries; supports policy-based
    stepback/warnings.

  - FrameworkContextEditor: Specialized editors for all mesh frameworks
    (impact, safety, identity, etc.), tied to policy DSL.

  - ProvenanceLog: Chronological, filterable log of all context/memory
    actions, edits, CDS, migrations.

  - NotificationOverlay: In-app and out-of-band (email, Slack, registry
    banner) notifications for migration, drift, error, CDS events.

- **Adapters & API Integration** (Priority: High)

  - DataAPIAdapterPort: Connects widgets to backend using OpenAPI spec
    /docs/spec/context.yaml#/paths/1v11context~1get, with error envelope
    on every call.

  - CDS/Drift Adapter: Hooks for all context error, migration, drift
    notifications, and global kill-switch for unremediated issues.

  - MigrationOverlayAdapter: Guides users/admins through migration
    steps, with side-by-side before/after and policy explanations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users land on the ContextDashboard, with a module to connect framework
  APIs and pre-populate a guided onboarding walkthrough that shows how
  to read context status and act on CDS events.

- First-time users see a sample session with preloaded CDS event and a
  stepwise demo of remediation and memory structure.

- Admins and devs see a YAML/JSON config panel with real-time preview
  (context window size, TTL, CDS policies, etc.).

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** ContextDashboard displays live memory usage, key framework
  context slices, and highlight tiles for any drift, CDS, or migration
  advisories.

  - Color-coded alerts for context state (healthy/warning/error).

  - Clearly summarized session milestones; click-through to detailed
    view.

- **Step 2:** MemoryViewer enables users to explore all memory tiers
  (working, session, long-term, episodic), diffing previous and current
  states, with undo/restore controls.

  - Edits, rollbacks, and rationale are tracked and displayed in
    ProvenanceLog.

  - A11y support: high-contrast, keyboard navigation, full ARIA live
    regions for alerts.

- **Step 3:** If CDS is detected (e.g., context drift or degradation),
  CDSDriftOverlay appears.

  - Users can review, undo, restore previous context, add rationale, or
    request admin override.

  - CDS event and remediation is logged, error envelope sent if context
    not restored.

- **Step 4:** SessionSummaryEditor enables editing and approval of
    session/long-term summaries; compliance warnings shown if summary is
    inconsistent or triggers policy constraints.

  - Side-by-side versioning, comment system, change history.

- **Step 5:** FrameworkContextEditor allows framework-specific context
  editing—impact, safety, passion, velocity, etc.—all mapped to policy
  DSL and context API.

  - Templated views ensure only permitted fields are editable (per
    policy).

- **Step 6:** NotificationOverlay surfaces all critical events:
  migration required, CDS issue unresolved 24h+, registry disables if
  drift persists 30d.

  - Users can snooze notifications (unless policy blocks), admins
    receive digest and must sign off before release.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power-user support: custom filtering/sorting of ProvenanceLog, bulk
  revert, or export as CSV/JSON.

- Widget disables itself if registry or CI/test fails.

- Real-time a11y validation: missing alert aria-live disables widget
  until fixed.

- Offline mode: read-only snapshot with banner warning.

- Error overlays: friendly, actionable, and detailed.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- High-contrast color palette, keyboard navigation, large/minimalist
  buttons for critical actions.

- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- Inline help overlays; context-sensitive tooltips for all
  framework/domain terms.

- Instant feedback on policy DSL errors and auto-complete for common
  policy elements.
