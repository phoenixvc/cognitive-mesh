# AI-Research-on-AI Recursive Loop PRD

### TL;DR

A Kubernetes-deployed mesh microservice enabling autonomous agents to benchmark their performance, propose and sandbox-test optimization hypotheses, and safely apply upgrades—all under human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval and robust audit control. This system accelerates self-improving AI at enterprise scale, reduces operational toil, and guarantees compliance and rollback on every autonomous change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Double the velocity of autonomous mesh model and agent upgrades—faster adaptation, less human bottleneck.
- Eliminate lag between cutting-edge tested research and deployment of improvements.
- Maintain continual compliance and auditability with all model/agent changes for regulatory and business trust.
- Minimize operational overhead by automating safe, looped validation cycles.

### User Goals

- Mesh operators have dashboard visibility, rights to approve or reverse all upgrades, and instant access to audit logs.
- Agents can self-benchmark, propose, test, and apply improvements as soon as efficacy is proven—no manual approval delays (unless required in protected domains).
- All upgrades include rationales, test results, and complete audit chains for transparency and trust.

### Non-Goals

- Does not allow unreviewed upgrades in regulated or critical domains—HITL policies always apply.
- Sandbox testing cannot access production data or APIs.
- No support for direct human-initiated experimentation outside the automated agent-driven loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.
- SysOps Engineers: manage model upgrades and ensure compliance.
- Mesh Agents: self-benchmark and propose improvements.
- Compliance Managers: oversee audit trails and regulatory compliance.
- Research Teams: monitor AI improvement cycles and outcomes.
- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- **SysOps Engineer:**
  - As a SysOps engineer, I want model upgrades to be auto-tested and tracked so that compliance/audits and rollbacks are seamless.
  - As a SysOps engineer, I need transparent access to approval, rollback, and chain-of-custody for every upgrade, so I trust the evolution process.
- **Mesh Agent:**
  - As a Mesh agent, I want to self-benchmark my capabilities, propose and test upgrades, and get better without waiting for humans, so that my performance continuously improves.
  - As a Mesh agent, I want all my improvements and test results to be logged so that the mesh learns from all optimization attempts.
- **Compliance Manager:**
  - As a Compliance Manager, I require every improvement to be logged, gated for approval in protected domains, and reversible at all times so that the business never loses control over self-evolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Agent-led Hypothesis Generation**
  - POST /ai-research/hypothesize: Agents propose improvement areas with baseline performance metrics. Returned: structured list of candidate hypotheses, metadata, and rationale.
- **Sandboxed Benchmark & Test**
  - POST /ai-research/test: Each hypothesis/model diff is tested in an isolated sandbox; logs results (score, failure types, time), reports with experiment hash, and sends immediate feedback to operator dashboard.
- **Safe Apply & Rollback**
  - POST /ai-research/apply: If a test passes in the sandbox and (if required) receives operator/HITL approval, the new model is deployed, with model artifact hash, rollout logs, and affected agent population.
  - Critical and regulated domains: automatic gating for explicit human approval.
  - Rollback function always enabled.
- **Real-Time Audit Chain & Status**
  - GET /ai-research/status: Tracks every proposal, test job, deployment, applied or rolled back improvement, and all associated logs and correlation IDs, updated in real-time.
- **Admin/Human Override**
  - Abort, reject, or rollback any upgrade at will via dashboard or API. Every override event is logged. No upgrade can bypass explicit approval where RBAC/HITL policy is enforced.
- **API Envelope & Versioning**
  - All endpoints adhere to shared error envelope (error_code, message, correlationID, data), OpenAPI v3 schema, and return schema version and correlation id.
- **Dedicated Dashboard**
  - Operators and compliance have a web dashboard listing hypotheses, running/tested upgrades, approval/rollback controls, chain-of-thought explanations, and exportable audit logs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all AI research and upgrade endpoints.
- 100% audit trail coverage for all hypothesis generation and upgrade events.
- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Sandbox testing isolation and security compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Admins discover the system via the Cognitive Mesh dashboard—"AI Self-Improvement" panel is visible to RBAC-approved operators only.
- Initial onboarding tutorial explains how agents evolve, HITL checkpoints, and audit log exports.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Agent detects a suboptimal metric, POSTs to /ai-research/hypothesize.
  - Dashboard shows pending hypotheses, with summaries and rationales.
- **Step 2:** Automated benchmark/test is triggered per hypothesis via /ai-research/test.
  - Operators see test queues, real-time sandbox status, logs, and outcome scores.
- **Step 3:** Successful tests surface for approval (if gated) or auto-apply (if not sensitive).
  - Approval UI enables quick HITL verdicts; all changes captured by correlation ID and timestamp.
- **Step 4:** Upon approval, agent/model upgrade is deployed via /ai-research/apply, with full deployment and versioning logs.
  - UI shows pre/post-performance scores, chain-of-thought, and explicit rollback button for every change.
- **Step 5:** Dashboard can export all events, actions, and logs for reporting or compliance.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Bulk approval or blocklisting—multiple upgrades can be validated or stopped at once.
- Slack/email notifications for urgent approvals or errors.
- Audit trail export as signed PDF/JSON for compliance.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Clear, color-coded job statuses (pending, testing, success, failure, awaiting approval, deployed, rolled back).
- Rich "explainability" UI: All upgrades have rationale, before/after metrics, and chain-of-thought logs.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, high-contrast UI for critical review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

Dr. Kim, a Cognitive Mesh operator at a global healthcare platform, logs in Monday morning to review the system's self-improvement pipeline. One edge-agent has proposed a gradient descent tweak—flagging a recent regression in error rate. Dr. Kim opens the dashboard and sees automated test results, performance comparisons, and a clear approval workflow. The AI has already validated the improvement in sandbox, and Dr. Kim can approve with confidence, knowing the system maintains complete audit trails and rollback capabilities. This autonomous improvement cycle accelerates innovation while ensuring compliance and control.

The platform's agents continually self-monitor, propose, and deploy improvements—always providing Dr. Kim with irrefutable chains of evidence, instant control, and complete peace of mind that their AI is both powerful and under trustworthy control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Python FastAPI backend, containerized to run as AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) pod; async orchestration with Celery for scalable test job dispatch.
- Models, hypotheses, and test metrics tracked using MLflow; artifacts stored in Azure Blob.
- Sandboxing: Each benchmark/test launches in isolated AKS namespace or ephemeral Docker node (no prod data or APIs in test).
- RBAC/HITL: All API and dashboard actions tightly scoped by Azure AD and per-domain policy.
- Secrets/credentials for model upgrades and task orchestration stored/retrieved exclusively via Azure Key Vault.

### Integration Points

- Mesh audit/tracking: All pre/post upgrade, status, and rationale logs piped to central audit store (Azure Monitor; Prometheus/Grafana for system events).
- Notification integrations: Slack/email via Azure Logic Apps or webhook.
- Compliance exports: Chain-of-custody logs exportable as PDF or signed JSON.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No model/test ever accesses live data in sandbox.
- All logs, event actions, and artifacts encrypted at rest (Azure Blob/Cosmos).
- Operator actions and audit trails retained for 2+ years.

### Scalability & Performance

- Minimum: 20 concurrent sandbox jobs per 4-core node; hits 100+ on scale-out.
- All endpoints stateless and horizontally scalable under AKS.
- Job queue and resource pool guardrails—dynamic quotas to prevent overload.

### Potential Challenges

- High parallelism can stress Kubernetes cluster—dynamic scaling and quota management a must.
- Approval flow must never block emergency rollbacks.
- Chain-of-thought log volume—advise data retention policies to avoid storage bloat.
- Compliance edge: HITL logic must be tunable per domain, and immutable for regulated sectors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
