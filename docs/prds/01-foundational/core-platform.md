# Cognitive Mesh Core Platform

### TL;DR

The Cognitive Mesh Core Platform provides a secure, compliant, and
extensible foundation for all MCP-powered micro-products across the
enterprise. It covers unified authentication, authorization, and audit
(AAA), a plugin registry for module discovery/versioning, and robust
orchestration APIs, all shaped for zero-trust and NIST AI RMF
compliance. This enables teams to safely develop and scale AI
capabilities in days, not weeks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Onboard at least 5 internal product teams onto the Cognitive Mesh
  within 4 weeks.

- Ensure 99.9% uptime of mesh services.

- Achieve average P95 API latency below 200 ms across core mesh
  endpoints.

- Cut time-to-market for new micro-product integration to under 2 days.

### User Goals

- Offer a single, robust AAA service for all mesh endpoints (Azure AD,
  RBAC, and audit).

- Simplify discovery, registration, and versioning of micro-products in
  a secure plugin registry.

- Deliver real-time, actionable compliance monitoring and reporting
  (NIST AI RMF).

- Provide seamless integration points, maintain high platform
  reliability and observability.

### Non-Goals

- Not designed as a general-purpose LLM hosting platform.

- Not a direct end-user app (no chat, search, or analytics UI).

- Does not replace domain-specific micro-product logic (e.g., DocRAG,
  PRDGen, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Platform Engineering Team**

- As a platform engineer, I want to integrate new AAA modules in one
  place so that every mesh service benefits from consistent
  authentication and authorization.

- As a platform engineer, I want to onboard new micro-product teams
  quickly so that we minimize time spent on operational overhead.

**Security & Compliance**

- As a compliance auditor, I need tamper-proof logs and compliance
  dashboards so I can demonstrate NIST AI RMF adherence.

- As a security lead, I need to enforce zero-trust and region
  restriction policies by default for all mesh APIs.

**Micro-Product Teams (e.g., DocRAG, PRDGen)**

- As a micro-product owner, I want to register and update my module with
  minimal friction so I can ship features faster without compromising
  security.

**DevOps & Infra**

- As a DevOps engineer, I want unified config and health APIs for mesh
  services so I can automate deployment and observability pipelines.

**Enterprise Architects**

- As an architect, I want a modular, well-governed AI runtime so our
  organization’s micro-products can scale without compromising
  compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **AAA & Security** (Priority: P0)

  - **FR-P1: Core AAA**  
    Mesh runtime must integrate Azure AD authentication and enforce RBAC
    (role-based access control) on all endpoints.

  - **FR-P2: Audit Logging**  
    All API calls, essential parameters, responses, and cost data must
    be logged to a tamper-proof, append-only store.

- **Plugin & Module Registry** (Priority: P0)

  - **FR-P3: Plugin Registry**  
    Securely register, discover, update, and version micro-products
    within the mesh, with isolation per module.

- **Mesh API Services** (Priority: P1)

  - **FR-P4: Mesh Orchestration API**  
    Expose endpoints such as /api/mesh/discover and /api/mesh/health for
    runtime module/Liveness checks.

  - **FR-P5: Config Loader**  
    Unified environment and settings management, including secret
    integration (e.g., Key Vault), via .env and providersettings.json.

  - **FR-P6: Compliance Dashboard**  
    Provide continuous compliance monitoring, auto-generating NIST AI
    RMF reports from /api/mesh/compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users (platform and micro-product teams) gain access via secure Azure
  AD login with immediate RBAC permissioning.

- New services are registered through an onboarding wizard (web
  console/API), with guided setup for role assignment, secret storage,
  and audit configuration.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Register Micro-Product

  - Micro-product owner submits registration (API or UI), including
    metadata, RBAC config, and plugin version.

  - The platform validates module, performs static checks, enables audit
    hooks.

  - Owner receives confirmation and health status endpoint.

- **Step 2:** Secure Authenticated Access

  - Authenticated modules use platform-issued tokens for all mesh API
    calls.

  - All calls automatically subject to AAA and audit.

- **Step 3:** Compliance & Health Monitoring

  - Teams access the compliance dashboard to check current posture,
    issue NIST AI RMF reports, and review logs.

  - Real-time health and discover APIs facilitate runtime orchestration
    and DevOps monitoring.

- **Step 4:** Ongoing Operations

  - Platform auto-updates registry, handles module version upgrades, and
    enforces policy updates.

  - Audits, security testing, and compliance runs are
    scheduled/triggered as needed.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Support module deprecation and version rollback.

- Alert users to failed health checks or out-of-policy access.

- Catch and report any unauthorized access or config file anomalies.

- Automated reminders for teams that lag on compliance or OS patching.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Minimal, forms-driven admin console for onboarding and monitoring.

- Accessible color palettes, clear error handling, and inline
  documentation.

- Searchable plugin registry with filter/sort by type, team, region, and
  compliance status.

## Narrative

In a global enterprise pushing dozens of AI micro-products live each
quarter, keeping security, compliance, and agility in harmony is a daily
challenge. Product teams spend weeks wrangling authentication,
permissions, and audits—slowing down both innovation and time-to-market.
Meanwhile, security leads worry about undetected policy gaps, and
auditors labor to piece together compliance records from scattered logs.

The Cognitive Mesh Core Platform is built to end this chaos. It provides
a single, trusted control plane that delivers authentication,
authorization, and audit “as-a-service” to every micro-product. With
zero-trust as the default, airtight region controls, and real-time
logging, every team gets security and policy “for free.” Its plugin
registry means shipping a new AI module is as easy as registering,
versioning, and watching it go live—no three-week onboarding or custom
security hoops.

When a new regulatory requirement lands or a security vulnerability
appears, platform updates roll out automatically via the compliance
dashboard and secret-management APIs. Engineers and architects finally
get to focus on their product’s mission; security and audit are
always-on. After just one month, five teams are live on the mesh, bug
rates and incidents decline, and audit confidence goes up—a win for
every part of the business.

## Open Questions

1.  Should multi-region failover be implemented at launch, or in a
    subsequent phase?

2.  What upgrade/compatibility policy is required for micro-products as
    the mesh evolves?

3.  How granular should RBAC and access controls be for mesh-level APIs
    and cross-team operations?
