# Security & Zero-Trust Infrastructure Framework PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Foundational)

### TL;DR

This document establishes the foundational **Security & Zero-Trust Infrastructure Framework** for the entire Cognitive Mesh platform. It mandates a **Zero-Trust** approach to authentication, authorization, and network access, ensuring **end-to-end encryption**, **micro-segmentation**, and **robust security monitoring**. This framework is implemented across all existing mesh layers, complementing the Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework by providing the **technical enforcement** for all security, privacy, and compliance requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- **Achieve Zero-Trust by Default:** Implement a security posture where no entity (user, service, agent) is trusted by default, requiring explicit verification for every access attempt.
- **Minimize Attack Surface:** Reduce potential vulnerabilities across all layers of the Cognitive Mesh through secure coding practices, hardened infrastructure, and continuous vulnerability management.
- **Ensure Data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA):** Protect all data at rest, in transit, and in processing from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
- **Automate Compliance Enforcement:** Integrate security controls directly into the development and deployment pipelines, ensuring continuous compliance with regulatory and organizational mandates.
- **Accelerate Secure Innovation:** Provide a secure-by-design platform that enables rapid, compliant development and deployment of new AI capabilities without compromising security.

### User Goals

- **Secure Access:** Users can confidently access Cognitive Mesh services knowing their data and interactions are protected by robust security measures.
- **Transparent Security:** Users understand the security posture of the system and how their data is protected, fostering trust.
- **Resilient Operations:** Users experience predictable and uninterrupted service, even during security incidents, due to automated incident response and recovery mechanisms.
- **Privacy by Design:** Users' privacy is protected through enforced data access policies and encryption, aligning with ethical and legal frameworks.

### Non-Goals

- This PRD does not define specific security policies (these are managed by the Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework PRD).
- It does not cover physical security of data centers.
- It does not replace the need for security operations center (SOC) personnel, but provides the tools and data for their effective operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Persona: Security Architect (Alex)**

- As a Security Architect, I want to define fine-grained access policies for every service and data resource, so that I can enforce least-privilege access across the mesh.
- As a Security Architect, I want to ensure all data is encrypted end-to-end, so that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized interception or access.

**Persona: DevOps Engineer (Ben)**

- As a DevOps Engineer, I want automated security scans integrated into my CI/CD pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are detected and remediated before deployment.
- As a DevOps Engineer, I want to manage secrets securely, so that credentials are never hardcoded or exposed.

**Persona: Incident Response Lead (Chloe)**

- As an Incident Response Lead, I want real-time alerts for suspicious activities and policy violations, so that I can respond to threats immediately.
- As an Incident Response Lead, I want comprehensive audit logs with correlation IDs, so that I can trace security incidents end-to-end for forensic analysis.

**Persona: Compliance Officer (Diana)**

- As a Compliance Officer, I want automated reports on security control effectiveness and compliance posture, so that I can demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements.
- As a Compliance Officer, I want to verify that data residency and sovereignty rules are technically enforced, complementing the ethical framework.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Zero-Trust Authentication & Authorization (Priority: Must)

- **Identity-Centric Access:** Every request (user, service, agent) must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of origin (internal or external).
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-auth.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1auth~1verify`
- **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Implement Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with dynamic policy evaluation.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-auth.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1auth~1authorize`
- **Continuous Verification:** Re-authenticate and re-authorize sessions periodically or on context change (e.g., IP change, privilege escalation).
- **Least Privilege Enforcement:** All components and users operate with the minimum necessary permissions to perform their function.

### 2. End-to-End Encryption (Priority: Must)

- **Data in Transit:** All communication between services, clients, and external systems must use TLS 1.3 or higher.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-encryption.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1data~1secure-transfer`
- **Data at Rest:** All persistent data (databases, file storage, backups) must be encrypted using AES-256 or FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-encryption.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1data~1at-rest-status`
- **Data in Processing (Homomorphic/Confidential Compute - Priority: Should):** Explore and integrate confidential computing technologies for sensitive data processing.

### 3. Network Security & Micro-segmentation (Priority: Must)

- **Service Mesh Integration:** Implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to enforce network policies, mTLS, and traffic encryption between microservices.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-network.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1network~1policy`
- **Micro-segmentation:** Isolate network traffic between individual services or logical groups of services, limiting lateral movement in case of breach.
- **Ingress/Egress Control:** Strict firewall rules and API Gateway policies to control all inbound and outbound traffic.

### 4. Infrastructure Security (Priority: Must)

- **Container Security:** Implement container image scanning, runtime protection, and immutable container deployments.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-infra.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1container~1scan`
- **Secrets Management:** Centralize secrets management using a dedicated vault solution (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) with strict access controls and rotation policies.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-infra.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1secrets~1rotate`
- **Vulnerability Management:** Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities in infrastructure, applications, and dependencies.
- **Configuration Management:** Enforce secure baseline configurations for all infrastructure components (servers, databases, networks).

### 5. Security Monitoring & Threat Detection (Priority: Must)

- **Centralized Logging (SIEM Integration):** All security-relevant logs (authentication, authorization, access, errors, policy violations) must be ingested into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-monitoring.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1logs~1security`
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Implement rules and analytics for detecting suspicious activities, anomalies, and known attack patterns.
- **Alerting & Notification:** Automated alerts for high-severity security events, integrated with incident response workflows.
- **Auditability:** All security events must be auditable, immutable, and retained according to compliance requirements.

### 6. Incident Response Automation (Priority: Must)

- **Automated Remediation:** Implement automated playbooks for common security incidents (e.g., blocking malicious IPs, isolating compromised services).
  - **OpenAPI:** `/docs/spec/security-incident.yaml#/paths/~1v1~1incident~1respond`
- **Forensics & Post-Mortem:** Ensure sufficient logging and data retention for forensic analysis and post-incident reviews.
- **Integration with Ethical & Legal Framework:** Security incidents involving privacy breaches or ethical violations must trigger specific workflows defined in the Ethical & Legal Compliance Framework.
