# Human-AI Boundary Definition Protocol PRD

### TL;DR

A mesh protocol layer that explicitly classifies and enforces per-task
boundaries: "human-only," "AI-only," or "collaborative." It routes,
blocks, and transparently surfaces boundary status and enforcement at
every interaction. UI overlays and middleware adapt live to maintain
clarity, compliance, and user trust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve zero AI overreach, ensuring full organizational compliance by
  strictly separating subjective and human-reserved decision zones.

- Provide auditors and compliance leads with complete traceability,
  logging all AI boundary actions and decisions.

- Build trust and adoption by showcasing a transparent and enforceable
  human-AI task protocol.

- Reduce compliance review cycles and dispute incidents by automating
  the enforcement and documentation of boundary rules.

### User Goals

- Empower users with clear knowledge of which parts of any workflow are
  handled by AI, humans, or a collaborative mode.

- Eliminate user anxiety about AI encroaching on subjective or sensitive
  decisions.

- Enable teams to confidently leverage AI efficiencies without fear of
  over-automation.

- Drive consistent collaboration experiences with clear, role-aware UI
  cues.

### Non-Goals

- The protocol will not automate subjective judgment or
  authenticity-dependent actions.

- Does not allow for runtime circumvention of boundary rules outside
  admin-level override.

- Does not aim to prescribe the actual content or design of
  collaborative overlays—enables, but does not dictate, UI
  implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Compliance Leads: ensure regulatory and internal policy compliance.

- End Users: interact with boundary indicators and overlays.

- System Admins: manage and audit boundary definitions.

- Designers: create UI overlays and indicators.

- Developers: implement middleware and enforcement logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a **Compliance Lead**, I want to enforce and track exactly what AI
  is permitted to do, so that I achieve regulatory and internal policy
  compliance.

- As an **End User**, I want every boundary status to be made explicit,
  so I always know if an action is handled by a human, AI, or both.

- As a **System Admin**, I want to update and audit boundary definitions
  in an immutable, fully-traceable way to ensure no accidental
  overreach.

- As a **Designer**, I want the system to surface clear visual overlays
  indicating boundaries—so users are never in doubt.

- As a **Developer**, I want middleware hooks that make it easy to
  enforce boundary rules without custom logic for each new service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Boundary Management**

  - *Zone Definition* (Priority: Must)

    - Returns current task and workflow boundary configuration (human,
      AI, collaborative) with admin-only update privileges.

    - GET /boundary/zones

  - *Enforcement Middleware* (Priority: Must)

    - Inspects each service call, blocks or routes per boundary, logs
      all enforcement/exception events with timestamp, user, and role.

    - POST /boundary/execute

  - *Collaborative Overlay* (Priority: Should)

    - UI widget auto-detects collaborative contexts and shows blended
      controls (e.g., shared input, co-signing).

    - Middleware exposes boundary type to frontend at every event.

- **Error Handling and Logging**

  - *Standard Error Envelope* (Priority: Must)

    - All responses use a shared error structure: error_code, message,
      correlationID, and data.

  - *Event Logging* (Priority: Must)

    - 100% of enforcement decisions and exceptions are logged with
      immutable record.

- **Role Management**

  - *Admin-Only Updates* (Priority: Must)

    - Only authorized admins can update or override boundary
      definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% of enforcement events are logged and auditable.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all boundary actions and user events.

- 99.9% uptime for boundary enforcement and logging endpoints.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users encounter a boundary status indicator (e.g., icon or banner)
  upon task entry; onboarding includes a brief protocol overview showing
  the meaning of each boundary type.

- Admins use a web dashboard to define, review, and audit zones. The
  interface prevents non-admins from making changes.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** The user initiates or accesses a task.

  - System displays current boundary type ("AI-only," "Human-only,"
    "Collaborative") with an always-visible indicator and tooltip.

- **Step 2:** User takes an action (e.g., submits, requests automation,
  or seeks help).

  - Middleware automatically checks task boundary via GET
    /boundary/zones. If in "Human-only," AI-related actions are blocked,
    user is informed, and a logged rationale is surfaced.

- **Step 3:** If action is allowed (AI-only/collaborative), middleware
  processes request, logs event, and—if collaborative—UI displays
  blended controls for joint action.

- **Step 4:** If user attempts to cross a boundary (e.g., invokes AI in
  human-only task):

  - The system issues a real-time prompt, denies action, and logs a
    non-dismissible event.

- **Step 5:** In collaborative scenarios, UI overlays guide human-AI
  interaction, making provenance and responsibility explicit per
  micro-action.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Power users and admins can request an audit trail for any workflow,
  tracing all enforcement points.

- In case of multiple boundary violations, a summarized report is
  generated and surfaced to compliance.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Boundary iconography is color-coded and uses unique shapes/symbols for
  accessibility.

- All overlays support ARIA labeling and screen readers.

- All controls and overlays are responsive for mobile and desktop.

- System nudges user if attempting out-of-bounds actions, with clear,
  non-technical explanations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

In a rapidly-advancing workplace where decisions are made
collaboratively, the risk of AI overreach isn't just technical—it's a
matter of compliance, trust, and user confidence. Picture a compliance
lead overseeing sensitive hiring workflows or strategic deal approvals:
the HumanBoundary protocol ensures every action is clearly attributed,
every boundary is enforced, and every exception is logged. When a user
attempts to cross a boundary, the system blocks the action, explains why,
and records the event for audit. The result: trust, compliance, and a
culture of responsible AI adoption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics
