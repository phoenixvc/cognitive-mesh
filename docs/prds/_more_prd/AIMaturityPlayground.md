# AI Maturity Gamification Widgets (Frontend)

### TL;DR

A bundle of React-based gamification widgets, delivered as secure
plugins on the Cognitive Mesh dashboard, providing users and engineers
with live AI maturity status, achievements, and actionable feedback.
Visualizes XP progress, badge unlocks, journey progression, and
organizational benchmarks, all powered by backend APIs integrated via
the PluginOrchestrator. Designed for dynamic roles, real-time
responsiveness, and robust, privacy-respecting feedback loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Raise end-user and engineer proficiency with Cognitive Mesh and AI
  concepts by 30% in the first quarter after rollout.

- Increase feature adoption rates for core AI tooling and best practices
  by 20% within two months.

- Sustain \>80% weekly engagement with dashboard widgets across priority
  roles.

- Drive measurable improvements in user sentiment and AI maturity
  awareness.

- Reduce support requests tied to AI operations and platform usage
  through self-guided, in-app feedback.

### User Goals

- Instantly understand current AI maturity level, recent progress, and
  earned badges from a single dashboard view.

- Receive actionable tips on how to level up AI usage and achieve the
  next stage in the maturity model.

- Track and celebrate tool adoption milestones (e.g., Explainability
  Tool, LangSmith intro).

- Compare personal and team/org progress for learning, friendly
  competition, and leadership insights.

- Experience frictionless, error-resilient notifications and feedback
  for key actions—never left wondering "what's next?"

### Non-Goals

- Widgets do not implement backend business logic or maturity
  calculation (must route all logic via APIs).

- No direct access to underlying platform APIs or storage—backend-only
  communication via PluginOrchestrator.

- Widgets do not expose sensitive user actions or raw API keys to the
  browser.

- No auto-enrollment or forced leaderboard participation—respect
  privacy/roles per org policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- All Users: interact with gamification widgets and dashboards.

- Engineers: integrate widgets and monitor engagement.

- Team Leads/Managers: review team/org progress and coach users.

- Admins: manage widget configuration and permissions.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see my current AI maturity status, progress bar,
  and badges on my personalized dashboard, so that I know how I am
  developing and what to focus on next.

- As an engineer, I want recognized tool adoptions and complex actions
  (e.g., multi-agent orchestration) to surface as achievements and grant
  visible rewards, so that I can measure technical growth.

- As a team lead or manager, I want to compare team and org-wide
  maturity metrics at-a-glance, so that I can identify learning gaps and
  coach effectively.

- As an admin, I want all widgets to smoothly handle data errors and
  permissions issues, ensuring robust, trustworthy UI at all times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **XP/Progress Bar Widget** (Priority: High)

  - Visualizes current user XP and progress toward the next AI maturity
    milestone.

  - Displays milestone tips and contextual recommendations for
    advancement.

  - Reacts instantly to backend updates, adjusting UI in real-time.

- **Badge Wall** (Priority: High)

  - Shows all earned, locked, and upcoming badges, with visual cues and
    filter/search.

  - Tooltips contextualize badge meaning, criteria, and suggest next
    actions.

  - Drill-down to view reward history and engagement with each badge.

- **Maturity Journey Map** (Priority: Medium)

  - Outlines the user's current maturity model stage, highlights gaps,
    and guides toward the next level.

  - Animated map with accessible navigation, tailored recommendations.

- **Org Leaderboard** (Priority: Medium)

  - Ranks individuals, teams, or org units by maturity level, XP total,
    or badge count.

  - Sort by date, achievement, or role; highlight user's own position if
    relevant.

- **Activity Feed/Notification Widget** (Priority: Medium)

  - Real-time, in-dashboard notifications for achievement unlocks,
    maturity jumps, and event feedback.

  - Ability to replay recent events; always accessible from dashboard
    summary.

- **Widget Packaging and Delivery**

  - All widgets loaded dynamically via WidgetRegistry and
    DashboardLayoutService.

  - All configuration via WidgetDefinition; each widget supports
    role-based visibility and per-user config.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all widget and API endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all gamification and feedback events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- User accesses the Cognitive Mesh dashboard and authenticates.

- First-time users greeted with onboarding carousel explaining XP,
  badges, and journey concept.

- Widgets positioned per org/user default and saved via
  DashboardLayoutService.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Widgets initialize by securely fetching maturity data via
  PluginOrchestrator (no direct backend/API key exposure).

  - XP/Progress Bar loads and fills according to user's latest maturity
    event.

  - Badge Wall visibly indicates newly unlocked achievements.

- **Step 2:** Real-time updates from backend push new milestone alerts
  to Activity Feed.

  - On badge or stage unlock, both Badge Wall and Activity Feed update
    and trigger a toast notification.

- **Step 3:** Maturity Journey Map animates newly reached stages, and
  presents "next action" tailored by backend recommendations.

  - Org Leaderboard visualizes comparative progress, updating for
    user/team whenever new events are registered.

- **Step 4:** All widgets consistently handle permission/role-driven
  visibility; unconfigured or restricted widgets show a compliant access
  note, not an error.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Widgets support dark/light themes, customizable layout, and
  mobile/tablet responsiveness.

- Error states (network fail, backend schema issue, data missing)
  trigger standard error envelope UI using error_code, message,
  correlationID.

- Widgets can be removed, rearranged, or added via Plugin Marketplace if
  enabled.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Robust focus/keyboard navigation for accessibility (meets WCAG AA).

- High contrast and font scaling for readability.

- Live response to backend event streams with minimal flicker or
  latency.

- Consistent error/pending/loading skeleton design for all widgets.

- Persistent settings per user stored securely (no PII leakage in the
  client).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

A new user logs into the Cognitive Mesh dashboard and is greeted by a gamified XP bar and badge wall. As she completes onboarding and adopts new tools, she unlocks achievements and sees her progress mapped visually. Team leads compare progress across teams, and admins monitor engagement. When a milestone is reached, a notification appears, and the leaderboard updates. The result: higher engagement, faster learning, and a culture of continuous AI maturity improvement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

- Number of users and teams actively engaging with gamification widgets.

- Percentage increase in AI maturity and feature adoption rates.

- User satisfaction scores (CSAT/NPS) for gamification experience.

- Audit/compliance pass rate for gamification logs.

- Number of achievements and milestones unlocked per month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tracking Plan

- Track widget load, engagement, and achievement events.

- Log all audit and compliance events.

- Monitor user feedback and dashboard usage.

- Track error and remediation events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Architecture & Integrations

  - /api/gamification/xp: Returns XP and progress data.

  - /api/gamification/badges: Returns badge status and history.

  - /api/gamification/journey: Returns journey map data.

  - /api/gamification/leaderboard: Returns leaderboard data.

  - /api/gamification/notify: Triggers notifications and feedback.

- **Admin Dashboard:** UI for widget configuration, audit, and compliance review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Each widget packaged as a signed, versioned, self-contained React
  bundle via the plugin registry.

- Data communication strictly via PluginOrchestrator; all API calls use
  standardized envelope { error_code, message, correlationID, data }.

- WidgetDefinition and runtime config support per user, per role, and
  per dashboard instance.

- Widget events (XP gain, badge unlock) surfaced in real time through
  backend push or polling.

### Integration Points

- PluginOrchestrator for secure API mediation (Backend-for-Frontend).

- WidgetRegistry and DashboardLayoutService for dynamic load/config
  management.

- Maturity backend and gamification event APIs (XP, Badges, Progress,
  Events).

- Backend event bus for real-time updates.

- Error envelope source-of-truth in shared code/schema repo.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- No persistence of sensitive data in the browser; all user state/config
  stored in backend or authorized secure storage.

- Widget events tracked only via anonymized, correlationID-tagged logs.

- Personal data handling conforms to org's privacy, GDPR, and
  role-restriction policies.

### Scalability & Performance

- All widgets must load/react within specified NFRs under expected user
  and team load (\>10k DAU).

- Support lazy loading, selective rendering, and memory-efficient
  virtualized tables/grids.

### Potential Challenges

- Schema or API version drift between backend/event APIs and widgets.

- Handling partial or delayed event delivery in real-time update flows.

- Ensuring accessibility, multilingual support, and theming consistency
  across contributed plugins.

- Preventing unauthorized widget/plugin injection or manipulation
  (rigorous plugin code-signing and review).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Layer Mapping & Shared Schemas

**Layer Mapping:**

- All widgets reside in the UI Layer, managed by the WidgetRegistry and
  DashboardLayoutService.

- Widgets loaded by dashboard as secure plugins; no direct backend
  access.

- All API calls routed via PluginOrchestrator (Backend-for-Frontend).

**Shared Schemas:**

- All API responses use a common envelope:  
  { "error_code": \<string|null\>, "message": \<string|null\>,
  "correlationID": \<string\>, "data": \<object|array|null\> }

- Widget configuration, badge data, maturity progress, and leaderboard
  results are schema-versioned; breaking changes flagged at runtime with
  detailed error_code/message.
