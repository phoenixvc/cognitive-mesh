# Adaptive API Docs & Helper Overlay

### TL;DR

Dynamically adapts API documentation, playgrounds, and code samples to
match each user's AI maturity—providing guardrails, deep-dives, or
fast-tracks as appropriate. Overlays respond to activity/events, enable
living tutorials, and reduce ramp-up friction for new or advanced users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Reduce new user onboarding and API ramp-up time by 40%.

- Cut support requests and critical API errors by at least 30%.

- Drive adoption of advanced/secure API features among \>50% of relevant
  user segments.

- Support continued increase in customer satisfaction (CSAT/NPS).

### User Goals

- Provide instantly relevant, contextual help—tailored by each user's
  maturity.

- Remove friction for beginners through in-doc guidance and inline
  validation.

- Enable advanced users to toggle straight to expert tips, advanced
  config, or skip mode.

- Ensure overlays never block or degrade the core documentation
  experience.

### Non-Goals

- Will not restrict user access to any core API docs or endpoints.

- Will not replace core documentation frameworks or external doc
  hosting.

- Will not require users to install additional plugins to consume
  overlays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Developer Relations: primary users for API docs and overlays.

- Admin/Doc Authors: manage overlay content and engagement metrics.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**End User – Novice**

- As a new user, I want proactive walkthroughs, safety warnings, and
  "try-it" code examples while exploring docs, so that I can confidently
  start building without mistakes.

- As a newcomer, I want my failed API attempts to trigger relevant help
  overlays, so that I can fix problems quickly.

**End User – Advanced**

- As a power user, I want overlays to default to advanced/hidden mode,
  surfacing only next-level tips or in-depth config when prompted, so
  that I stay productive.

**Admin/Doc Author**

- As an admin or doc author, I want to version, A/B test, and retire
  overlay content, so that users only see accurate and effective help.

- As an admin, I want to view engagement metrics for overlay content, so
  that I can optimize tutorials and guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Overlay Service**

  - Detects user maturity (XP, badge, role) and applies
    context-appropriate overlays in API docs or playgrounds.

- **Content Engine**

  - Maintains overlays, tips, advanced snippets, safety warnings—each
    version-controlled and tagged semantically for easy rollback,
    retirement, or A/B testing.

- **Trigger/Event Engine**

  - Defines which maturity events, usage patterns, or errors fire
    overlays. Mapping managed and updatable in admin UI.

- **Fallback Mode**

  - If overlays API or content engine fails, base documentation always
    renders—users never blocked from core content.

- **Telemetry**

  - Tracks overlay displays, interactions, dismissals, clicks, and
    related user actions for continuous improvement and reporting.

- **APIs**

  - /docs/overlay/load/:user loads overlays for the user profile.

  - /overlay/track_event logs overlay engagement events.

  - /overlay/content/admin supports admin operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥95% of overlay loads complete within 200ms.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all overlay events and user actions.

- 99.9% uptime for overlay and content APIs.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users access API documentation or playground as usual. All overlays
  are injected natively; no extra steps required.

- First-time or low-maturity users are automatically prompted with
  welcome/tour overlays outlining basic docs usage and first API call.

- Opt-out or skip is clearly accessible.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** User interacts with documentation or playground.

  - Overlay service detects maturity score and loads appropriate overlay
    set.

  - For low-maturity: Shows step-by-step guides, highlighted try-it
    buttons, and warnings.

  - For high-maturity: Collapses guidance, surfaces advanced config
    blocks.

  - Error or anomaly (e.g., multiple failed API calls) prompts
    troubleshooting overlay.

- **Step 2:** User interacts with overlays—reads, clicks CTAs,
  dismisses, or opts for advanced mode.

  - All interactions tracked via telemetry for feedback loops and admin
    insight.

- **Step 3:** As user matures (badges earned, errors resolved,
  documentation milestones reached), overlays progressively unlock more
  advanced content and fast-track features.

- **Step 4:** Overlay engine checks for content updates or retirement
  every 10 minutes, ensuring users only see up-to-date overlays.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Admin/Doc Author can retire outdated overlays or push experimental
  tips to A/B cohorts.

- If overlay service or content API fails, documentation loads with no
  overlays or error blocks—no user interruption.

- Fast-track toggle for advanced users universally available.

- Localization or regional content possible via overlay tags.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All overlays are minimally invasive—accessible, dismissible, and
  keyboard-navigable.

- Color contrast, responsive design, and WCAG AA+ compliance built into
  overlays.

- Overlays respect dark/light mode and integrate seamlessly with
  existing doc frameworks (Swagger, Redoc, etc).

## Narrative

Janet, a data scientist new to the AI platform, opens the API playground
for the first time. She's greeted by a clear overlay guiding her through
her first API call, complete with safety warnings and inline code
snippets. When she fumbles a request, a troubleshooting overlay pops up
with a direct link to an example. As Janet progresses, she earns badges
and her overlays shrink—revealing advanced configuration guidance and a
toggle to hide basic tips. Meanwhile, admins watch as engagement with
overlays increases, using metrics to optimize future content and tutorials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- ≥70% of new users interact with at least one overlay during onboarding
  (tracked via /overlay/track_event).

- Documented new-user API errors drop by ≥40% within six months.

### Business Metrics

- ≥50% adoption of advanced/secure API features among targeted users
  within twelve months.

- CSAT/NPS gain attributable to support/helpfulness of doc overlays.

- Support tickets related to API onboarding drop ≥30%.

### Technical Metrics

- Overlay service P99 latency \<200ms for all injected overlays.

- 100% of retired overlays and content no longer display within 10
  minutes.

- Overlay engine uptime meets/exceeds 99.95% SLO.

### Tracking Plan

- Track overlay load, interaction, and dismissal events.

- Log all audit and compliance events.

- Monitor user feedback and content update actions.

- Track error and remediation events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Architecture & Integrations

- **Overlay Service:** Injects overlays into API docs and playgrounds.

- **Content Engine:** Manages overlay content, versioning, and A/B testing.

- **Telemetry Service:** Tracks user interactions and engagement.

- **API Endpoints:**

  - /docs/overlay/load/:user: Loads overlays for the user profile.

  - /overlay/track_event: Logs overlay engagement events.

  - /overlay/content/admin: Admin operations for content management.

- **RBAC/AAA Service:** Enforces access control and credential management.

- **Audit Logging Service:** Stores immutable logs for all overlay events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Modular overlay engine plugs into any documentation or playground
  product (Swagger, Redoc, custom).

- Versioned overlay content (semantic versioning), served via API.

- Telemetry pipeline for user events, async and batched for privacy.

### Integration Points

- User maturity data from XP/badge service.

- Existing doc and playground UI—lightweight injection (iframe or JS,
  but secure/sandboxed).

- Admin author/editor UIs (existing admin tool or stand-alone page).

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All overlay clicks, loads, and dismissals logged to central
  telemetry—no PII or sensitive data.

- Engagement logs pseudo-anonymous; direct comms always require opt-in.

- Overlay content versioned, audit-logged; removal/retirement cascades
  to all clients within 10 min.

### Scalability & Performance

- Overlay API must support spikes during product launches or onboarding
  surges.

- Fallback mode to ensure core doc load never exceeds baseline latency.

- Client bundles kept lean to minimize doc/playground load time.

### Potential Challenges

- Ensuring overlays never block/hide core documentation elements.

- Robustness to errors or failures in overlay content service.

- Consistency across doc frameworks; maintaining UX parity in custom
  versus out-of-the-box docs experiences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
