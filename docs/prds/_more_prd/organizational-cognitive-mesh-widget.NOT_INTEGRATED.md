# Organizational Cognitive Mesh Mesh Widget PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Transformation Scoped)

### TL;DR

Widget suite operationalizes Organizational Cognitive Mesh: empowers
users, admins, and leaders to drive cultural transformation, manifestos,
safety assurance, identity evolution, passion-driven AI, adoption
velocity, and compliance. All panels and adapters are contract-bound,
CI-tested, and auditable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve 100% AI adoption at the organizational level by making
  transformation visible, actionable, and supported in daily workflows.

- Increase employee AI-proficiency and comfort by tracking and publicly
  celebrating cognitive sovereignty, identity evolution, and
  psychological safety.

- Normalize AI experimentation and failure as core to innovation,
  reducing resistance and aligning cultural practices across teams.

- Ensure compliance and transparency through persistent policy/manifesto
  versioning, audit trails, and clear communication overlays.

### User Goals

- Give every employee a transparent, self-serve map for their AI
  journey—showing sovereignty, safety, and personal/professional
  evolution.

- Allow teams to showcase adoption wins, share passion-driven projects,
  and match for mentorship.

- Enable admins to monitor safety, adoption health, and velocity;
  trigger interventions and provide feedback in real time.

- Provide frictionless reporting, migration flows, and overlays to
  ensure no one is left behind in transformation.

- Offer rights-respecting, autonomy-supportive settings for those who
  move at a different pace (“sovereignty-first” users).

### Non-Goals

- This product does not enforce a single mandatory AI adoption pace for
  all individuals.

- It does not expose granular employee-level AI usage without consent
  (privacy-respecting by design).

- The widgets do not deliver standalone enterprise training or serve as
  an exclusive identity management platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

In a global company starting its AI organizational journey, employees
find themselves either excited or hesitant. The new Organizational
Cognitive Mesh Widget suite empowers every user with a transparent
dashboard showing where their team stands on AI adoption, psychological
safety, and identity evolution—making invisible cultural undercurrents
visible for the first time. Managers see at a glance who needs
encouragement, who's thriving, and which teams are held back by fear or
unclear policies. Passion-driven employees can discover projects that
align with their interests and instantly match with mentors. Policy and
manifesto editors ensure all voices are heard, with overlays guiding
users through every migration or update. When registry drift occurs,
feedback and migration banners escalate transparently, reducing
confusion and accelerating resolution.

As quarters pass, adoption grows: overlays nudge feedback, dashboards
celebrate progress, and the organization's AI manifesto evolves as a
living document. Even mistakes and hesitations are normalized and
celebrated as learning, not failure. Employees feel supported, safe, and
proud of their progress—while leadership sees real-time evidence of
cultural momentum, not just compliance. Over time, AI isn't just a
technology project; it's a deeply human, ever-evolving organizational
capability—visible to all, owned by everyone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Number of passion projects submitted and mentorships matched

- User satisfaction with overlay guidance and feedback tools

### Business Metrics

- AI adoption rate (org and team level) and improvement delta

- Organizational AI proficiency distribution (novice → expert
  progression)

- Registry/audit completion rate for manifestos and safety overlays

- Reduction in policy/compliance migration incidents per quarter

### Technical Metrics

- Progress clicks on F-Scale and passion registry

- All consent, feedback, and migration remediation actions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Frontend mesh widget panels (OrgDashboardPanel, ManifestoEditorPanel,
  SafetyMonitorPanel, etc.)

- Contract-bound adapters mapping to persistent backend APIs using
  OpenAPI (e.g., /docs/spec/orgmesh.yaml#…)

- Registry/migration and notification logic at the UI shell and
  widget-level overlays

- Modular, versioned policy and feedback schema support

### Integration Points

- Org SSO/workspace login and provisioning

- Backend API and registry endpoints

- Slack/email/Webhook integration for migration, alert, and consent
  overlays

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Pseudonymized telemetry and consent tracking logs

- Registry disables for non-migrated or out-of-date panels

- No user-level AI data exposure without explicit opt-in

- Compliance-ready audit logging and download

### Scalability & Performance

- Load tested to support 5,000 concurrent users per org; cold start \<1s

- Client cache and prefetching for overlays (cache \<8MB)

- Registry-driven migration disables to prevent split-brain UX

### Potential Challenges

- Edge-case handling: simultaneous registry, migration, and overlay
  events

- Alignment across team-level and org-level overlay states

- Maintaining a11y as custom overlays evolve

- Ensuring timely registry/alert delivery during outages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Overlays, Migration & Error Envelope

- All overlays match shared pattern for error, migration, feedback, and
  registry alerts.

- Error schema: { error_code, message, correlationID }, used in every
  G/W/T test, overlay, and telemetry.

- Migration triggers registry/email/Slack alert and forces overlay
  notification and registry disable after 30 days if not fixed.

- Feedback and review overlays for all panels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Visuals, Telemetry, Research Hooks

- Inline: OrgMesh flow diagram, dashboard overlay, F-Scale/identity
  chart, migration pattern, passion registry leaderboard.

- Telemetry schema: { panelId, eventType, userId, orgId, timestamp,
  correlationID, error_code, feedback }.

- Research hooks: feedback, review, peer learning, and change impact
  logging for transformation analytics.
