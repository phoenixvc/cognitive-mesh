# Organizational Cognitive Mesh Backend Architecture PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Transformation Scoped)

### TL;DR

This backend builds a first-class Organizational Transformation Layer
into the Cognitive Mesh. It enables real-time cultural context
engineering, dual manifesto/policy management, continuous safety and
sovereignty monitoring, adoption velocity tracking, identity progression
support, and actionable organizational feedback. APIs are
contract-bound, NFRs are strictly defined, overlays are auditable, and
all integration points are designed for transparency, compliance, and
agility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Drive systematic and measurable transformation toward AI-augmented
  culture at the organizational level

- Ensure legal, compliance, and risk management requirements are met for
  all AI-powered workflows

- Accelerate safe and impactful adoption of AI across teams and roles,
  tracked and benchmarked in real time

- Monitor and increase employee engagement, psychological safety, and
  innovation velocity

- Establish the Cognitive Mesh as a differentiator in organizational
  learning and transformation

### User Goals

- Employees, managers, and leaders can clearly see how AI is impacting
  their roles and how to navigate professional identity evolution

- Teams feel psychologically safe experimenting with AI and reporting
  challenges or failures

- All stakeholders have direct visibility into manifesto, policy, and
  collective progress, with opportunities for feedback

- Passion-driven AI projects and adoption wins are recognized, tracked,
  and amplified

- Users understand sovereignty options and their right to informed,
  empowered AI usage

### Non-Goals

- Does not govern AI model selection, algorithm-level optimization, or
  individual tool licensing

- Does not prescribe industry- or role-specific AI workflows beyond
  providing flexible frameworks

- Excludes foundational LLM, cognitive agent, or knowledge retrieval
  capabilities unless used for organizational overlays

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- CXOs: oversee transformation and adoption.

- HR: manage employee engagement and feedback.

- Compliance Officers: ensure legal and policy compliance.

- Team Leads: drive team-level adoption and feedback.

- Employees: interact with dashboards and overlays.

- IT/Admins: manage configuration and onboarding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**People Operations Manager**

- As a People Ops Manager, I want to view a real-time dashboard of AI
  adoption, psychological safety, and sovereignty signals, so that I can
  tailor support and direct interventions to the right teams.

**Team Lead**

- As a Team Lead, I want to log and review team feedback on AI
  experimentation, so that I can normalize failure, surface passion
  projects, and celebrate meaningful successes.

**Compliance Officer**

- As a Compliance Officer, I want to review the latest policy and
  manifesto versions, audit change records, and monitor for policy drift
  or overdue updates, so that the organization stays compliant and
  audit-ready.

**Employee**

- As an Employee, I want to give feedback on my AI experiences, see how
  my identity is evolving, and access passion project communities, so
  that I feel safe and motivated to use AI in my work.

**AI Governance Lead**

- As a Governance Lead, I want to configure organization-level
  parameters (safety threshold, review frequency), receive migration
  notifications, and control transparency overlays, so that governance
  is transparent and future-proof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Cultural Transformation Management** (Priority: High)

  - Track, analyze, and report signals from meeting logs, direct
    feedback, audits, and employee input on adoption, migration, ritual,
    and communication

- **Manifesto and Policy Dual-Document Management** (Priority: High)

  - Version-controlled, CRUDable Manifesto and Policy APIs

  - Automated registry, Slack/email notifications for all drafts,
    migration triggers, reviews, and overdue events

- **Psychological Safety Monitoring** (Priority: High)

  - Aggregate experimentation signals, failure-reports, and sovereignty
    preferences organization-wide

- **Adoption Velocity Tracking** (Priority: Medium)

  - Measure and report adoption rates, passion-driven project momentum,
    and cross-team innovation velocity

- **Identity Transformation Management** (Priority: Medium)

  - Track professional identity progression (Fear → Familiar → Fluent →
    Fun) and support overlays for self-assessment and milestone
    celebration

- **Feedback and Notification Processing** (Priority: High)

  - Collect meeting, training, and feedback data via scalable adapters
    and escalate issues or insights as overlays, notification, or
    registry entries

- **Migration and Drift Handling** (Priority: High)

  - Automated detection of schema/register drifts and support for
    contract-bound migration overlays

- **Configurable Governance** (Priority: High)

  - Parameterized org-level YAML/JSON configs for key policies (review
    cycles, safety thresholds, passion enablement)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all dashboard and API endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all transformation and feedback events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- System is enabled centrally by the AI Governance or IT Admin via
  secure credentialing and config (YAML/JSON)

- Teams and admins receive onboarding overlays introducing manifesto,
  policy, sovereignty principles, and feedback mechanisms

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Organizational events (e.g., all-hands, trainings) trigger
  context ingestion and analysis by CulturalTransformationEngine

  - Real-time evaluation of adoption, safety, and sovereignty signals;
    minimal manual data wrangling

  - Alerts/overlays appear where thresholds or contractual requirements
    are breached

  - System logs and attributes all events for compliance and escalation,
    with rationale for about decisions surfaced

- **Step 2:** Users/managers access the OrgDashboardPort to view live
  metrics, feedback, identity charts, manifestos, and safety signals

  - Drilled-down overlay data for teams, projects, or individual
    progression/milestones

- **Step 3:** Policy and Manifesto are reviewed/approved via the
  ManifestoPort; overdue update triggers overlays, registry
  notifications, and Slack/email alerts to admins

  - All changes and audits are logged with full version control/history

- **Step 4:** Team feedback and identity progression are submitted and
  processed via FeedbackProcessor and IdentityTransformPort

  - Direct overlays for celebrating progression, noting passion-driven
    wins, or advising on sovereignty

- **Step 5:** Registry or integration events (migration, policy drift)
  trigger NotificationAdapter to push overlays and registry updates

  - Consumers are notified, overlays deployed, and registry disables
    non-upgraded consumers after 30 days

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Registry disables panels and overlays for non-migrated endpoints after
  30 days, with a clear sign-off/resume path

- All overlays, dashboards, and panels support locale/a11y from first
  release, with strict contract gating for all registry entries

- Comprehensive support for asynchronous feedback, migration
  intervention, and audit logs with rationale and timestamped signatures

**UI/UX Highlights**

- All overlays and dashboards contract-bound to relevant APIs, with
  migration ability and a11y built-in

- Feedback, dashboard, and notification panels are context- and
  role-aware

- Every interaction, escalation, or migration is fully auditable and
  versioned

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Config, Overlay, and Governance

Example YAML/JSON config for organizational policy:

orgmesh: manifesto_review: 'quarterly' safety_threshold: 0.7
passion_enabled: true

- All overlays, registry/email/Slack migration notices, and new
  policy/manifesto reviews are contract-enforced

- Breaking migrations: overlays deployed for 30 days, non-compliant
  consumers disabled until upgrade, explicit sign-off path

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Error Envelope Schema & Audit

All adapters, overlays, and APIs use a shared error schema:

{ error_code, message, correlationID }

All outputs, overlays, and registry integrations are logged with:

- Timestamp

- Rationale

- Impact level

All changes, reviews, and migrations are auditable and versioned for
compliance, transparency, and continuous learning.
