# Mesh Agent Communication Protocols & Integration PRD

### TL;DR

The MetacognitiveLayer enables agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-to-tool
interactions using a range of standards—ontology-based ACLs (FIPA-ACL,
KQML), natural language protocols (NLIP), function-calling, and modern
REST/gRPC transports. All protocols will be mesh-discoverable,
auditable, secure, and context-rich. This allows Cognitive Mesh agents
to orchestrate, negotiate, and operationalize workflows
flexibly—internally and with external agent ecosystems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Seamlessly orchestrate workload and negotiation among internal and
  third-party agents for rapid, reliable business outcomes.

- Ensure all agent communication within and across the mesh is
  traceable, secure, and policy-compliant for regulatory peace of mind.

- Unblock engineering velocity by making it trivial to add new
  agent/communication protocols as the ecosystem evolves.

### User Goals

- Empower operators and developers to discover, configure, and
  prioritize agent protocols in the mesh—fast and with minimal learning
  curve.

- Enable agents to find and speak the right "language" with minimal
  friction, optimizing for the best workflow or external integration.

- Offer real-time observability, error feedback, and failover so users
  trust the agent mesh in critical business flows.

### Non-Goals

- Building or maintaining "homegrown" communication languages outside
  open standards.

- Supporting protocols that lack baseline security (no mTLS/JWT) or
  registry/audit compatibility.

- Directly supporting ultra-niche (research-only) agent frameworks not
  aligned with the long-term mesh vision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Mesh Operators: enable/disable protocols, enforce compliance.

- Agent Developers: register and integrate agent protocols.

- Integrators: connect external agent frameworks.

- End Users: benefit from orchestrated agent workflows.

- QA/Test Automation: validate protocol reliability and error handling.

- Security & Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Mesh Operator**

- As an operator, I want to enable or disable agent communication
  protocols for each workspace, so I can enforce compliance and
  performance.

- As an operator, I want to view which agents support which protocols,
  so I can plan secure, efficient workflows.

- As an operator, I want to audit agent-to-agent/tool message logs, so I
  can trace issues or satisfy compliance checks.

**Agent Developer**

- As an agent developer, I want to declare supported ACLs/protocols and
  register with the mesh, so external agents can reliably integrate with
  my services.

- As an agent developer, I want to leverage mesh-managed context frames
  and transport security, so I can focus on agent logic, not plumbing.

**End User/Integrator**

- As an end user, I want to chain multiple agents using their preferred
  communication style, so I can automate work without protocol
  translation.

- As an integrator, I want to connect external agent frameworks (e.g.,
  JADE, Aries, LangChain) with minimal code, so I accelerate
  time-to-value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **ACL/Conversation-Standard Messaging** (Priority: Must)

  - Envelope supports performative (inform, request, query),
    sender/receiver, ontology ID, conversationId.

  - Mesh schemas (ACP/MCP) formally support ACL headers with
    validator/handlers.

  - FIPA-ACL, KQML standards built into protocol plugins.

- **Secure A2A Protocols (DIDComm, mTLS/JWT)** (Priority: Must)

  - Every A2A call is mTLS/JWT secured; each message is signed,
    audit-logged, and rejects unregistered senders.

  - Message signing/verification, circuit-breaker, fallback/handoff to
    human queue.

- **NLIP/Natural-Language/Function Calling** (Priority: Must)

  - Handler for schema-less NLIP payloads; Registry supports OpenAI
    Function Calling, Semantic Kernel, etc.

  - NLIP handler pluggable; allows mixed natural language and structured
    JSON.

- **REST/gRPC & Pub/Sub Transports** (Priority: Must)

  - Every agent or connector declares supported transports (REST, gRPC,
    Pub/Sub).

  - Health/metrics endpoints provided per transport, support for batch,
    buffering, and backoff.

  - Support for Kafka, MQTT, and DDS as pub/sub/syndication layer for
    swarms.

- **Shared Context Frames** (Priority: Must)

  - Every comm (A2A or A2T) can include a ContextFrame (beliefs, goals,
    provenance, memory, provenance, etc.) in arbitrary JSON.

  - ContextFrame Serializer/Deserializer required; ties directly to
    MeshMemoryStore.

- **Policy, Circuit-Breaker, Fallback, and Audit Enforcement**

  - All protocols and handlers must comply with mesh's NFRs for
    failover, fallback, and audit trail.

- **Mesh Registry Extensions** (Priority: Must)

  - Each protocol/handler appears in the Mesh Registry with: name,
    priority (must/should/could), schemaVersion, supported transports,
    endpoints for health/metrics/version/schema.

  - All agents and external adapters can discover and negotiate
    supported protocols during registration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all protocol and registry endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all agent communication events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Operators access the Mesh Registry dashboard to enable/disable protocols and review agent registrations.

- Developers register agents and declare supported protocols via API or UI.

- Integrators connect external frameworks using registry-discovered protocols.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Operator configures protocol support for a workspace.

  - Mesh Registry updates available protocols and agent compatibility.

- **Step 2:** Agents communicate using selected protocols; all messages are signed, logged, and auditable.

- **Step 3:** Users and integrators chain agents and tools using preferred protocols; errors and fallbacks are surfaced in real time.

- **Step 4:** Compliance and security teams audit message logs and protocol usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative

A mesh operator at a large enterprise needs to orchestrate workflows across internal and third-party agents. Using MeshAgentCommunicationProtocols, she enables FIPA-ACL and REST for her workspace. Agent developers register their services, declaring supported protocols. As agents communicate, all messages are signed, logged, and auditable. When a new external framework is integrated, the registry negotiates protocol compatibility. The result: secure, flexible, and transparent agent orchestration across the Cognitive Mesh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Mesh Registry dashboard lists all available/integrated agent protocols
  with their status, priority, docs, and health metrics.

- Operator or developer can enable/disable protocols and assign
  priorities per workspace/business line.

- External agents declare supported protocols on registration, visible
  in dashboard and via GET /protocols.

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Operator selects or adds a protocol-handler plugin in the
  Registry.

  - UI clearly shows protocol name, description, schema, priority, and
    transport type.

  - Operator reviews doc/spec, and toggles integration as needed.

  - Health/metrics endpoints display protocol readiness.

- **Step 2:** Agent Developer implements declared protocol endpoints or
  plugs SDK into their service.

  - Receives handshake for schema/sample messages.

  - Protocol negotiation occurs; agent knows which protocols/transports
    are accepted.

- **Step 3:** Message passing between agents follows negotiated protocol
  specs (ACL envelope, ContextFrame, etc.)

  - Errors, signing failures, or audit alerts are surfaced in the
    dashboard.

- **Step 4:** Operator observes real-time logs; can drill into specific
  messages, inspect audit trails, and review signing/verification data.

- **Step 5:** If circuit-breaker/failover is triggered, fallback path is
  logged and user is alerted.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Operator can assign "must/should/could" priorities to protocols for
  rapid mesh alignment with business or compliance needs.

- Bulk onboarding of external agents; automatic prioritization and
  compatibility checks.

- On error, agents can escalate to human handoff (e.g., Slack
  notification or queue), maintaining audit and context.

- Operators/owners can export all protocol registry data, audit logs, or
  health stats for compliance reviews.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Dashboards show clear grouping by protocol family, priority, and
  integration health.

- High-contrast, accessible modals for protocol/plugin details.

- Responsive, mobile-friendly Registry and operator consoles.

- Comprehensive search/filter by agent, protocol, domain, and status.

## Narrative

The Cognitive Mesh aims to be the world's most adaptive multi-agent
system—capable of speaking the "language" of any agent, tool, or AI in
the ecosystem.  
When a leading enterprise seeks tightly-governed automation spanning
internal bots, LLM-powered assistants, and credentialed external APIs,
the mesh's operator logs into the console. In minutes, they discover
every available communication protocol—FIPA-ACL for classic negotiation,
NLIP for free-form LLM flows, and secure DIDComm for identity. With a
few toggles and zero redeploys, they prioritize which protocols run
where—assigning standard, secure messaging to mission-critical
workflows, while enabling flexible task-chaining via LLMs for research
teams.  
As traffic flows, every message—whether structured ACL, Pub/Sub event,
or whimsical AI prompt—is cryptographically signed, contextually
enriched, and never lost. Operators track traffic in real time, receive
instant alerts on failures, and confidently pass audits. Developers
onboard new agent frameworks or update schemas without internal petition
or downtime.  
The outcome: The business gains the best of fast-evolving agent
capabilities and bulletproof governance. The mesh adapts with every new
protocol on the horizon—making the enterprise unstoppable.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- API endpoints and schemas for each protocol and transport

- Core Mesh Registry with per-protocol metadata, priorities, schema
  versions, health, and metrics

- Pluggable handler/adapter architecture for each protocol (ACL, NLIP,
  REST/gRPC, PubSub, ContextFrame)

### Integration Points

- Registry-compatible agent SDKs for at least: JADE, SPADE, Aries,
  LangChain, OpenAI Function Calling, Semantic Kernel

- REST/gRPC/PubSub connector compatibility for Kafka, MQTT, DDS/ROS2,
  internal data bus

- Interop with existing Mesh audit trails, auth (mTLS/JWT), and
  MeshMemoryStore

### Data Storage & Privacy

- Every message contextually wrapped; all audit logs and payloads
  persisted to the mesh's long-term log store

- All agent/transport activity is consent-aware and can be tied to
  organizational RBAC/ACP policies

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 100+ simultaneous protocols (must/should/could) and
  thousands of A2A/A2T messages per second

- Auto-scaling mesh control plane; protocols can scale horizontally

### Potential Challenges

- Protocol version drift and dependency upgrades among open-source agent
  frameworks

- False positive circuit-breaker/failover triggers on temporary outages

- Migration planning for protocol priority or business domain shifts
