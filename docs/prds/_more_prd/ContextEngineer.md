# Cognitive Mesh Context Engineering Backend PRD (Hexagonal, Mesh Layered, Multi-Framework)

### TL;DR

This backend transforms Cognitive Mesh by treating context as a
systematically engineered discipline, not an afterthought. It delivers
dynamic orchestration, multi-tier memory management (working,
short-term, long-term, episodic), context degradation syndrome (CDS)
prevention, and framework-specific context mapping for each cognitive
capability. All features are explicitly mapped, contract-bound,
testable, and version-controlled to enable resilient, production-grade
cognitive augmentation for teams and organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Achieve measurable reduction in AI decision errors attributed to
  context loss or drift.

- Enable multi-framework, domain-specific AI workflows through
  composable, reusable context APIs.

- Ensure production-grade reliability and auditability of cognitive
  decisions and knowledge flow.

- Decrease time to deploy business-specific frameworks by integrating
  context engineering as a first-class layer.

- Differentiate Cognitive Mesh as the most context-resilient, adaptive,
  and auditable AI architecture on the market.

### User Goals

- Users' decisions, outputs, and recommendations reflect all available,
  relevant context—never just the last prompt.

- Stakeholders experience fewer context-driven errors and receive
  proactive alerts on drift/fading/vagueness.

- Specialized agents and frameworks function with rich,
  framework-specific context without manual configuration.

- Stakeholders and admins can audit, tune, and intervene in memory/state
  for compliance, transparency, or troubleshooting.

- Context is meaningfully surfaced and visualized to all relevant UX
  layers and system actors.

### Non-Goals

- Do not cover UI/UX or frontend display logic (deferred to widget PRD).

- Do not support legacy, one-shot prompt-based workflows.

- Do not duplicate business logic from upstream frameworks; focus only
  on context/data, not domain rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stakeholders

- Product Owner: defines requirements and tracks adoption.

- Prompt/App Developers: primary users for context APIs.

- Cognitive Mesh Operators: manage memory and context policies.

- Business Stakeholders: review context health and audit logs.

- End Users: benefit from context-rich AI experiences.

- QA/Test Automation: validate reliability and error handling.

- Compliance: ensure audit and regulatory compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Stories

**Personas**

- Cognitive Mesh Operator (Admin)

- AI Agent Developer

- Business Stakeholder

- End User (Knowledge Worker)

**Stories**

- As a Cognitive Mesh Operator, I want to define memory and context
  policies, so that agents automatically select the right level of
  context for every workflow.

- As an AI Agent Developer, I want a contract-driven API to retrieve,
  update, or purge any type of memory (working, session, long,
  episodic), so that my agent's reasoning never loses key data.

- As a Business Stakeholder, I want to receive proactive alerts if
  context degrades (drift, vagueness, contradiction), so that decisions
  remain reliable and compliant.

- As an End User, I want my AI solutions to remember my preferences,
  history, and unique knowledge across sessions, so that my experience
  feels consistent, personal, and valuable.

- As a Mesh Operator, I want clear audit logs and rollback options for
  every context change, so that I can trace, validate, or correct any
  decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Requirements

- **Context Orchestration & Management (Priority: Critical)**

  - Dynamic orchestration of all context flows across agents and
    frameworks.

  - Adaptive management of context memory tiers: working, short-term,
    long-term, episodic.

  - Contract-based context CRUD, TTL, promotion, audit, and policy/tag
    management.

  - Notification and alerting on context drift, vagueness, or
    contradiction (CDS) per policy.

- **Framework-Specific Context Mapping (Priority: Critical)**

  - Explicit context contracts for each framework (impact, safety,
    passion, identity, etc.).

  - FrameworkContextMapper orchestrates context requirements and output
    delivery.

  - Prioritized, adaptive context weighting and orchestration for
    multi-framework intersection scenarios.

- **CDS Prevention & Drift Management (Priority: High)**

  - Real-time detection of context degradation patterns (drift,
    forgetting, contradiction, vagueness).

  - Automated CDS intervention: alerts, rollback, and remediation paths.

  - Configurable thresholds and policies for degradation management.

- **Audit & Summarization (Priority: High)**

  - Full audit trail for all context and memory changes, accessible by
    API.

  - Session and memory summarization for review or export.

  - Promotion paths for significant context events (e.g., session →
    long-term, episodic).

- **Governance, Resilience & Migration (Priority: High)**

  - Migration/upgrade endpoint: registry, notification (email/Slack),
    overlay flows.

  - Shared error envelope for all APIs.

  - Full versioning and resilience: auto-disable/all-clear on missed
    migrations.

- **Integration & Monitoring (Priority: Essential)**

  - Integration-ready, OpenAPI 3.1 with strict JSON pointer mapping.

  - Central registry of all context APIs and adapters.

  - Ready-to-integrate APIs for observability, failure, and improvement
    measurement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Functional Requirements

- ≥99.9% uptime for all context APIs and endpoints.

- 100% audit trail coverage for all context and memory events.

- Automated test coverage of at least 80% for critical code paths.

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Admins onboard by creating memory and CDS policy via DSL or API.

- Developers register new agents and frameworks, specifying context
  contracts.

- Stakeholders set up alert preferences (email, Slack, overlay).

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** Agents and frameworks invoke ContextAPI for retrieval or
  update.

  - API returns requested context tier(s), audit log, and context-health
    score.

  - If action violates drift threshold or triggers CDS, system posts
    alert and suggests corrective action.

- **Step 2:** Context changes (CRUD, promotion, TTL expiry) are written
  to audit trail.

  - If summary/export is enabled, system generates checkpoint for
    downstream review.

- **Step 3:** CDSPreventionAdapter monitors all flows, triggering
  process overlays, notifications, or automated rollback.

  - Admins and stakeholders may investigate or intervene via API if
    alerted.

- **Step 4:** Migration/upgrade events display overlays and push
  notifications as needed, giving a 30-day action window before
  auto-disable.

- **Step X:** System maintains complete audit and policy logs for
  ongoing compliance and review.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Drift/collision prevention between two simultaneous agent context
  updates.

- Full context handoff during mesh partition/failover.

- Transparent CDS alerting for subagents/agent collectives.

- Extensible schema for custom memory tiers or hybrid context-mesh
  integrations.

**UI/UX Highlights**

- Out of scope (deferred to frontend-specific PRD).

## Narrative

A prompt engineer is building a multi-agent workflow for a regulated industry. Using ContextEngineer, she defines memory policies and context contracts for each agent. As the system runs, it dynamically manages context tiers, detects drift, and alerts her to any degradation. She audits the context flow, tunes policies, and ensures compliance. The result: robust, context-rich AI that adapts to every workflow and never loses critical knowledge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
