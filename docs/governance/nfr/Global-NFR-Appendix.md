# Global Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Appendix – Cognitive Mesh

## Purpose and Scope

The Global Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Appendix establishes mandatory standards that apply to **all** components of the Cognitive Mesh platform—including core services, plugins, widgets, SDKs, and supporting infrastructure. These requirements cover security, telemetry, versioning, audit logging, privacy, quality, and compliance.

Every Product Requirement Document (PRD) for any platform, backend, or widget/feature **must explicitly reference and comply** with these NFRs.

Extensions or exceptions are allowed **only** if they are clearly documented, justified, and approved within the respective PRD.

## 1  Security

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Data in Transit** | All data exchanged between clients, services, and third parties **must** be encrypted via TLS 1.2 or higher. |
| **Data at Rest** | All persisted data **must** be encrypted with AES-256 (or an org-approved equivalent). Encryption keys **must** be securely managed with least-privilege access. |
| **Access Control & Multitenancy** | Every service, plugin, and user interaction **must** enforce least-privilege access and strict tenant isolation. Cross-tenant access is prohibited without explicit, auditable consent. |
| **Secure Development Lifecycle** | All releases—core or plugin—require peer code review plus static / dynamic security scans **before** deployment. |
| **Pen Testing & Remediation** | Perform penetration testing on all major releases at least **quarterly**. High-severity findings **must** be documented and remediated within an agreed SLA. |

---

## 2  Telemetry & Audit Logging

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Comprehensive Logging** | Log all API calls, privilege escalations, data access events, and critical system or plugin actions. Each log entry **must** capture actor identity, timestamp, action, and relevant context. |
| **Log Retention & Integrity** | Retain logs per compliance policy (≥ 1 year unless stricter rules apply). Logs **must** be tamper-evident and maintain a defensible chain-of-custody. |
| **Plugin/User-Facing Telemetry** | Plugins/widgets **must** disclose telemetry usage. Non-essential analytics **must** offer user opt-out. |

---

## 3  Versioning & Compatibility

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Semantic Versioning** | All public APIs, plugin manifests, and dashboard schemas **must** use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. |
| **Compatibility Window** | Maintain backward compatibility for “n-1” major platform versions. Breaking changes require a published migration strategy. |
| **Deprecation Policy** | Provide a ≥ 90-day public notice for any breaking change, including upgrade steps. |
| **Incompatibility Handling** | Widgets/plugins incompatible with the running platform **must** surface a clear, actionable warning and provide a safe fallback. |

---

## 4  Privacy & Data Governance

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Data Regulation Adherence** | All personal data **must** comply with GDPR & CCPA (or stricter regional laws) globally. |
| **Consent for Data Sharing** | Explicit, informed user consent is required before sharing data across tenants or with third parties. |
| **Data Sovereignty Enforcement** | User and tenant data **must** remain logically and physically separated; cross-tenant access is technically blocked. |

---

## 5  Compliance

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Audit Frameworks** | Platform and subcomponents **must** be auditable for SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, and any mandated frameworks. |
| **Audit Trails** | All data-handling operations and user-consent events **must** be logged and accessible to compliance teams. |
| **Policy Updates & Training** | All personnel involved with Cognitive Mesh **must** complete annual security/privacy training covering latest requirements. |

---

## 6  Quality Gates & SLAs

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Availability** | Critical APIs & shell: ≥ 99.9 % monthly uptime. Document RTO/RPO for all major services. |
| **Performance** | • Initial dashboard + three default widgets: target &lt; 1 s, hard cap 2 s.<br>• Resource budgets per widget/session must be defined in implementation PRDs. |
| **Error Handling** | All user-facing errors **must** be actionable and internally logged. Widgets/services must degrade gracefully. |
| **Accessibility** | All UI elements **must** meet WCAG 2.1 AA and be fully internationalizable with locale fallback. |

---

## 7  Observability & Tracing

- All components **must** emit distributed traces (OpenTelemetry or equivalent) with cross-service correlation IDs.
- Latency, error rate, and throughput metrics **must** be exposed via the standard monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus).

---

## 8  Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Define global / per-tenant rate limits for orchestration, telemetry, and marketplace endpoints.
- Components **must** implement intelligent back-off / retry and log rate-limit breaches. Noisy plugins must not degrade platform stability.

---

## 9  Backup & Disaster Recovery

- Define backup frequency for every stateful service. Document and test RPO and RTO.
- Failover plans (pilot-light, warm standby, etc.) **must** be documented and drilled regularly.

---

## 10  Configuration Management & Secrets

- Store all secrets in a central secrets manager (e.g., Azure Key Vault). Hard-coding secrets is prohibited.
- Use immutable infrastructure and drift-detection tooling for config changes.

---

## 11  Incident Response & Change Management

- Maintain severity-based incident classifications with target response SLAs.
- Conduct blameless post-mortems for major incidents.
- All breaking changes require Change-Approval Board sign-off.

---

## 12  Data Residency

- Honor customer/tenant data-residency constraints (EU-only, US-only, etc.) with enforced geofencing and audit validation.

---

## 13  Chaos Engineering & SLA Validation

- Schedule regular fault-injection (“chaos monkey”) exercises.
- Perform quarterly SLA audits to prove ≥ 99.9 % availability and failover readiness.

---

## 14  Developer Sandbox & Isolation

- Provide isolated, production-replica sandboxes for plugin development/testing.
- Unvetted code **must not** access live production data.

---

## Referencing the Appendix in PRDs

Every Cognitive Mesh PRD **must** include:

> “This feature/component adheres to the Global NFR Appendix vX.Y.  
> Any deviations are documented below with justification and mitigation.”

For each deviation:

1. **State** what requirement is affected.  
2. **Justify** the business, technical, legal, or user need.  
3. **Define** mitigation and an auditable path to compliance.

*The Global NFR Appendix is a living standard, reviewed and updated periodically to align with evolving organizational, regulatory, and industry requirements. Product teams are responsible for ensuring ongoing compliance.*
